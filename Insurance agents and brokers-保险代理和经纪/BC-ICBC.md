### 初次申请人信息 Information FOR FIRST TIME APPLICANTS ###

选择申请哪种证书（个人、企业或伙伴关系许可证书），请在提交申请前阅读下面信息了解具体情况。

**开始工作前**

新申请人通常认为只要符合学历要求、找到工作签了劳动合同以后，就可以工作了。这是错误想法。事实上，你必须向协会提交正式申请，申请通过并获得许可证书后才能作为代理、销售和理算员从事相关工作。如果你没有相关的从业许可证，不可以从事保险活动。

**提交申请**

该网页上有大量信息，还有很多申请材料可以下载。超过百分之五十的申请材料都不完整的话，会导致许可证书申请被搁置。所以，要早些提交申请，并认真阅读证书申请资质要求和申请说明。其中包含你需要的所有信息，有助于你成功完成申请。

- 不要依赖于其他人告诉你怎么做。
- 不要让他人填写你的个人信息。
- 请花点时间详细了解整个申请流程。

如果你确定已经提交了所有要求的申请材料，整个流程会处理的很快很轻松。如果申请的是人寿保险、一般保险或理算员许可证书，请认真阅读“无犯罪记录审查”部分的信息。

可以通过“查询已得到许可人员”确认你的申请是否已被通过。如果你无法在线查询自己当前的申请状态，且距离申请材料提交已经过去10个工作日了， 你可以联系协会办公室，了解进一步情况。

协会会依据合适的要求审核你的申请材料，包括是否刑事、破产和以前的纪律或拒绝（criminal and bankruptcy and any prior disciplinary or licence refusals）。下面是具体概括的内容。

需注意的是，申请人必须在向协会提交申请之前，提交完整的申请材料（要求得犯罪纪律申请、申请费用、教育和工作经验证明材料）。

**拿到许可证后**

拿到许可证后，你需要承担很多责任与义务。仔细阅读协会规定和行为准则，阅读责任部分的内容了解自己应承担的责任。如果你无法遵守这些规定或行为准则，请联系协会办公室。

既然你已经选择了保险行业，较高的职业标准将有利于你和客户。如果你有协会发布的材料未涉及的执业疑问的话，请联系协会办公室，我们会尽可能帮助您。

**适用性审核**

协会制定相关规定的目的是使申请人满足协会对于保险许可证申请的资质要求。在审核申请材料时，审核人根据法案、规定和协会政策来确定申请人是否满足申请条件，是否需要对申请人进行进一步的调查。该部分内容只强调了对于初次申请人而言的重要信息。

犯罪记录和罪名

协会必须确保申请人和持有许可证的人员没有任何犯罪记录，因为任何有犯罪历史的个人都不符合许可证申请条件。所以，申请人必须提交一份个人犯罪记录审查，并告知所有已定罪名和待确定的控告，其中包括无条件的或有条件的释放。

申请人犯罪（罪名与工作相关）但是已释放的情况下，协会在审核申请人的合格性时候会考虑这些因素。

**未解决的额罪名指控**

协会不会考虑有相关犯罪记录的初次申请人的许可证申请，除非该罪名指控已被解除。如果罪名成立，申请人必须遵守协会关于有犯罪记录的申请人的处理指南。

**伙伴关系和企业**

对于伙伴、管理人员、董事人员、控股股东、员工和被提名人的犯罪指控（包含正在进行的指控），协会在决定其是否有合作伙伴和企业适用性时会考虑这些因素。在犯罪信息坦诚和审核方面，对所有申请人和已注册个人都有一样的要求。

**个人金融可靠性**

申请人需要根据申请表，提交有关破产立法下的相关安排和诉讼，不论是否关于金融产品和服务的销售。

**合作伙伴和企业的金融可靠性**

申请人需要根据申请表，提交有关破产立法下的相关安排和诉讼，不论是否关于金融产品和服务的销售。

**以前的纪律处分或许可证拒签**

协会要求申请人在申请表中说明任何有关的记录处分和诉讼情况（任何司法管辖区金融服务监管者、任何专业人士或职业人士对申请人的诉讼都包含在内），以这样的方式来确保申请人能够满足申请适应性要求。申请人还必须说明自己之前是否有过类似机构许可证申请/注册失败的经历。

> 
> Whether You Are Applying For An Indivdual, Corporate or Partnership Licence
> Please Read The Following Page In Its Entirety Before Finalizing Your Application.
> 
> **BEFORE YOU START WORK**
> 
> New applicants often believe they can begin work once they have completed the education requirements and have obtained employment or a contract. This is not true. Regardless of what you hear to the contrary, in order to work as an agent, salesperson or adjuster, you must submit a fully completed application to Council and the application must be approved before you are licensed. You may not conduct insurance activities if you do not hold an active licence.
> 
> **MAKING AN APPLICATION**
> 
> There is a great deal of information in this website and in the application packages you can download. In excess of 50% of applications received are missing something. This results in delays in the licensing process. Start the process early and read through the appropriate Licence Qualifications section and the application instructions carefully. These contain the information you need to complete your application accurately.
> 
> - Do not depend on someone else to tell you what to do.
> - Do not allow someone else to complete your personal information.
> - Do take the time to understand the whole process.
> 
> If you ensure you submit all the requirements as needed, the process will proceed more quickly and easily. If you are applying for a life insurance, general insurance or adjuster licence, read the Criminal Record Check section carefully.
> 
> You can see if your application has been approved through the Search Licensees. If you cannot confirm your licensing status through the website and it has been more than 10 business days since all of your application requirements have been received by Council, contact our office for further information.
> 
> Your application will be reviewed for suitability requirements, including criminal and bankruptcy and any prior disciplinary or licence refusals. An overview of this review is outlined below.
> 
> It is also important to note that applicants must submit a fully completed application, including as required a criminal record check, fees and proof of completion of the required education and experience requirements, before Council can make a determination on whether a licence will be issued.
> 
> **ONCE YOU HAVE A LICENCE**
> 
> Once you have a licence, you have a number of responsibilities and obligations. Read Council Rules and the Code of Conduct carefully and review the Licensee Responsibilities section to familiarize yourself with your responsibilities. If you have trouble locating either the Rules or the Code, call our office.
> 
> You have chosen a career in the insurance industry and setting high standards of practice can only help both you and your clients. If you have questions on practice issues that are not covered in Council's published material, contact our office and we will assist whenever possible.
> 
> **SUITABILITY REVIEW**
> 
> The Rules require applicants to satisfy Council they are suitable to hold an insurance licence before granting a licence. When considering a licence application, staff review the information provided in accordance with the Act, Rules and Council policies to determine whether a licence may be issued or further investigation is required. The information provided in this section addresses only highlights of the review conducted on a first time application.
> 
> Criminal Convictions and Charges
> 
> Council must ensure that applicants and licensees have not been convicted of any offence that reveals them unfit to hold a licence. Applicants are therefore required to obtain a CRIMINAL RECORD CHECK and disclose all convictions and pending criminal charges, including where an absolute or conditional discharge has been granted. 
> 
> Where the applicant has committed an offence for which a discharge has been granted and the offence is considered relevant, Council may review the circumstances in assessing the applicant’s suitability.
> 
> **Outstanding Criminal Charges**
> 
> Council will not consider first time applicants charged with a relevant offence until the charge has been disposed of. Then the applicant, if convicted, will be subject to Council’s guidelines regarding convictions.
> 
> **Partnerships and Corporations**
> 
> Council considers criminal charges (including pending charges) of partners, officers, directors, controlling shareholders, employees and nominees in determining the suitability of the partnership or corporation. All disclosure requirements and reviews are similar to those of individual applicants and licensees. 
> 
> **Financial Reliability of Individuals**
> 
> Applicants are required to disclose filings, arrangements or other proceedings under bankruptcy and insolvency legislation in which the applicant was involved, whether or not it is related to the sale or trade of financial products or services, in accordance with the application form. 
> 
> **Financial Reliability of Partnerships and Corporations**
> 
> Applicants are required to disclose filings, arrangements or other proceedings under bankruptcy and insolvency legislation in which the applicant was involved, whether or not it is related to the sale or trade of financial products or services, in accordance with the application form. 
> 
> **Prior Disciplinary Actions or Refusal of Licence**
> 
> Council ensures that applicants meet the suitability requirements by requiring them to disclose on applications any disciplinary actions taken or proceedings commenced against them by any financial services regulator (insurance or otherwise) or any professional or occupational body in any jurisdiction. Applicants must also disclose previous refusals of licences or registrations by such organizations.
