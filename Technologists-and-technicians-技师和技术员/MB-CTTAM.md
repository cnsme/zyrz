## Certification Requirements ##

CTTAM Certification is dependent on three elements:

-     Academics
-     Work Experience
-     Professionalism 

**认证要求**

CTTAM认证是基于3个因素独立的:

  - 学术
  - 工作经验
  - 专业性

#### Academics ####

Academic requirements must be in compliance with the National Technology Benchmarks that are the main accreditation and certification tool for the Canadian Council of Technicians & Technologists (CCTT) provincial members.

Engineering technology or applied science programs that are accredited by the Canadian Technology Accreditation Board (CTAB) meet the academic requirements of the National Technology Benchmarks. As a result, accredited programs do not require academic assessment by the CTTAM Panel of Examiners. Current and past accredited engineering technology programs are listed at www.cctt.ca

Applicants who are graduates of non-accredited technology programs would have their academics reviewed by the Panel of Examiners to determine if the program meets the general and discipline-specific National Technology Benchmarks. To adequately assess non-accredited programs, the Panel of Examiners may require a syllabus or course descriptions and outlines. If the academic program does not meet the benchmark for either technician or technologist, an academic reclassification program for further studies can be requested.

**Academic Self-Assessment**

Applicants of non-accredited programs are encouraged to perform a self-assessment of their academics by comparing their documented academics to the National Technology Benchmarks (NTB) at www.cctt.ca. By reviewing the NTB, applicants can self-assess against the academic standards of their discipline to determine if they wish to apply.

**学术**

学术必须符合加拿大技术人员和技师协会的相关标准,符合CTTAM省评审协会的要求。工程技术或者应用科学项目由CTAB加拿大技术认证委员会认证,同时符合国家相关标准。非专业毕业的申请人,审核人员会有自己的其他标准来审核。可能需要申请人员的课程大纲。例如学术报告,如果课程不符合相关评估标准,审核人员可能进一步要求其他学术材料。

**学术自我评估**

非专业的项目的申请人,可以进行一下自我评估,通过将其学术文件上传网站www.cctt.ca。通过网站评估,申请人可以自行了解自己是否符合申请要求。

#### Work Experience ####

Work experience requirements for certification include a minimum of two (2) years or 24 months of acceptable technical experience as determined by the Certification Board. The two years of work experience must include:

-     At least six (6) months of experience at a level consistent with the certification level that is to be granted, either Certified Engineering/Applied Science Technician or Technologist.
-     At least one year of work experience in Canada. 

For graduates of technology programs that included a co-op component, the co-op work experience can provide a maximum of six months work experience to the total requirement of 24 months.

The Certification Board reviews the applicant’s work history, detailed current job description and professional reference questionnaires to assess work experience and determine the classification.

Although Canadians use the terms 'Technician' and ‘Technologist’ generally to describe many different occupations, Engineering/Applied Science Technicians and Technologists are very distinct individuals. These are the people who, through a high degree of specialized training may use, test, repair, design, analyze and problem solve in a broad range of applied science and engineering areas. They are employed in a vast range of economic sectors, from manufacturing to telecommunications.

To learn more about the differences between Technicians and Technologists refer to the detailed CCTT approved Technician & Technologist Profiles.

**工作经验**

相关认证人员需要至少2年的专业工作经验,必须包括:

  - 至少有6个月的工程师或者应用技术人员的工作经验;
  - 至少在加拿大1年的工作经验;

相关专业毕业的申请人,至少保证2年内的6个月的高度相关的工作。评审委员会审核申请人的工作经验,当前的工作以及相关的专业问题等工作类问题来评定申请人的申请。即便加拿大用技术人员和技师描述许多不同的职业,工程师/应用科学技术人员以及技师还是有很多区别的。拥有高学历且学习专业课程的,会应用,测试,修复,设计,分析同时解决工作中遇到的问题。这类人在经济领域以及通信或者制造业工作。关于技术人员以及技师的更多区别,可以参照CCTT的简介。

#### Professionalism ####

Certified members must be of good character and are bound by the CTTAM Code of Ethics and Bylaws and The Certified Applied Science Technologist Act.

The professional reference questionnaires completed by the applicant’s references contain questions to aid in the assessment of good character by the Certification Board.

All applicants for certification must complete the CTTAM Professional Practice Exam. The purpose of this exam is to ensure that certified members are familiar with the CTTAM Code of Ethics and Bylaws and the Certified Applied Science Technologist Act.

Unethical conduct reflects adversely on all certified technicians and technologists. One distinguishing feature of any profession is that membership in that profession entails an ethical obligation to temper one’s selfish pursuit of economic success by adhering to standards of conduct that could not be enforced either by legal fiat or through the discipline of the market.” Ethical decisions are not always obvious or easy. Ambiguity, incomplete information, points of view and conflicting objectives can make an ethical decision difficult. Written standards, codes of ethics and a well developed decision making process make ethical decisions easier.

**专业性**

申请人员需要有良好的品质,同时符合CTTAM的到的准则。申请人需要完成CTTAM的专业评估。测试的目的是保证申请人员熟悉CTTAM的道德法则以及相关法案。不能遵守相关道德准则或者约束的人并不能进行申请。任何一个行业的显著特点就是要遵守一定的行业准则和法律约束。

## Work Experience and References ##

Work experience requirements for certification include a minimum of two (2) years or 24 months of acceptable technical experience as determined by the Certification Board.

The two years of work experience must include:

-     At least six (6) months of experience at a level consistent with the certification level that is to be granted, either Certified Engineering/Applied Science Technician or Technologist.
-     At least one year of work experience in Canada.

For graduates of technology programs that included a co-op component, the co-op work experience can provide a maximum of six months work experience to the total requirement of 24 months.

Applicants with foreign technical work experience must acquire a minimum of twelve months of technical work experience in Canada to be considered for certification. The foreign work experience can provide a credit of one year to the two year work experience requirement.

The Certification Board reviews the applicant’s work history, detailed current job description and professional reference questionnaires to assess work experience.

**工作经验**

工作经验:申请人至少需要拥有2年的相关工作经验。两年的工作经验需要包括:

  - 至少6个月的符合工程师/应用科技技术人员或者技师的工作经验;
  - 在加拿大的至少1年的工作经验;

专业的毕业的申请人,至少保证两年内有6个月的高度相关的工作。拥有国外工作经验的申请人,需要保证至少在加拿大1年的工作经验。国外工作经验能够增强申请人的申请信用。评审委员会审核申请人的工作以及当前的工作和专业性等等。

  - 推荐信(相关推荐人签字文件);

### Professional References ###

Applicants are asked to provide the names, full mailing addresses, professional designations and business affiliations of at least three persons (preferably C.E.T., A.Sc.T., C.Tech., or P.Eng.) who have a good knowledge of their character, capabilities and technical work experience in Canada. It is not mandatory that all three references have designations. However, at least one reference should have a professional designation.

It is recommended that the references have worked with the applicant for a minimum of six months. If the applicant has the required two years of work experience but has been in the current job for less than six months, the applicant should delay applying until at least six months of current employment has been attained.

Unless the applicant is self-employed, one reference should be the current and immediate supervisor.

The Certification Board may consider applications with only two professional references, providing that the applicant has given an explanation for this situation.

CTTAM will mail Professional Reference Questionnaires to the three references. All three completed professional reference questionnaires must be returned before the Certification Board will review the application. It is the obligation of the applicant to follow-up with their references to ensure that the completed questionnaires are returned to CTTAM. All information is strictly confidential between the reference and the Association.

Applicants who do not have the required work experience, such as recent graduates or newcomers to Canada without Canadian technical work experience, do not provide professional references.

**专业推荐信**

申请人需要提供名字,完整的邮寄地址,专业名称等已经评估机构的名称。3个专业评估机构名称不是强制要求的,但是至少需要2个。申请人最好至少保证6个月的工作经验。如果申请人并不满足2年内最少6个月的高度工作经验,申请可能被延迟。除非申请人是自雇,推荐信必须有当前的有效的推荐人的签字。CTTAM可能会对工作进行调查。这些调查问题必须在审核申请之前及时反馈到CTTAM。这些将直接影响评估结果。不符合工作经验的申请人,像刚刚毕业的或者刚到加拿大工作的申请人,不必提供相关推荐材料。

### Work History ###

Work history is Part B of the application form. The work history must be outlined on a separate page with a heading of Part B - Work History and the name of the applicant.

All applicants, except for recent graduates of technology programs, must complete Part B - Work History. Immigrants would include foreign work experience.

The work history should follow the format of a chronological listing of all past technical work experience that includes for each employment position:

-     Dates of employment (month/year),
-     Job Title,
-     Company Name,
-     Location,
-     Job Description,
-     Detailed Technical Experience,
-     Responsibilities and/or achievements.

Graduates of technology programs that included co-op work experience should indicate which jobs were co-op positions. Co-op work experience can be assigned a maximum of six months work experience towards the total requirement of 24 months.

Resumes generally are not written in a style to provide sufficient information about technical work history. It is recommended that a work history be submitted as outlined above.

A well-described work history is very critical for applicants who have been in their current position for less than two years.

**工作经验**

保证提供的整体推荐信在1-2页之间并由推荐人签字认可。

### Profiles for Technicians & Technologists ###

Although Canadians use the terms 'Technician' and 'Technologist' generally to describe many different occupations, Engineering/Applied Science Technicians and Technologists are very distinct individuals. These are the people who, through a high degree of specialized training may use, test, repair, design, analyze and problem solve in a broad range of applied science and engineering areas. They are employed in a vast range of economic sectors, from manufacturing to telecommunications.

**技术人员和技师简介**

即便加拿大用技术人员和技师描述许多不同的职业,工程师/应用科学技术人员以及技师还是有很多区别的。拥有高学历且学习专业课程的,会应用,测试,修复,设计,分析同时解决工作中遇到的问题。这类人在经济领域以及通信或者制造业工作。

### Engineering / Applied Science Technician ###

A technician generally uses a practical approach based on a detailed understanding of the field of technology being practiced. Many of the duties of the technician are similar to that of a technologist and other professionals but typically only in a very selective area of specialization.

While some duties of the technician may be similar to skilled craft or trades persons, these duties would not normally be of a routine nature and would only apply to sophisticated equipment or processes. A technician is bound by a professional code of ethics.

**工程师/应用科学技术人员**

技术人员一般使用基于科技的理解的实用方式运用都按工作中。技术人员的许多职责与技师很相似但是又不完全相同。技术人员的职责一般类似于熟练工艺者或者某些行业的技术人员。且技术人员通常遵守道德职业守则的约束。

**The technician may:**

-     examine assignments, objectives and instructions to select procedures and actions for resolving the assigned problem;
-     assist in the design of equipment or systems, assist in the interpretation and preparation or modification of specifications, technical drawings or instructions, prepare estimates and supervise phases of major projects;
-     conduct tests, build prototypes or models, operate pilot plants, trouble-shoot equipment, resolve production or construction problems, compile data and reports;
-     supervise phases of construction projects, inspect construction projects, conduct tests, surveys or prepare estimates for construction activities;

### CTTAM Policy and the Law and Ethics Exam ###

To stress the importance of professionalism, CTTAM policy dictates that applicants who have not completed the exam will not be recommended for certification.

Applicants who do not complete the Law and Ethics Exam within the 12 month deadline will be required to reapply for certification or made an Associate.

Applicants who are recommended for the Associate classification are not required to complete the exam until they are making application for reclassification. Even so, Associates are eligible to complete the Law and Ethics Exam at any time.

**CTTAM政策和法律与道德考试**

强调专业性和重要性,CTTAM决定没有完成道德测试的人不能进行认证。12个月内没有完成道德法律测试的,会被推迟认证。需要重新申请复议的申请人不能参加道德水平测试直到复议完成。即便如此,协会有资格在任何实践对于申请人进行法律和道德测试。

### The Purpose and Content of the Law and Ethics Exam ###

The purpose of the Law and Ethics Examination  is to ensure that certified members are familiar with the CTTAM Code of Ethics and Bylaws and the Certified Applied Science Technologist Act, as well as sections of The Engineering and Geoscientific Professions Act:

Unethical conduct reflects adversely on all certified technicians and technologists. One distinguishing feature of any profession is that membership in that profession entails an ethical obligation to temper one's selfish pursuit of economic success by adhering to standards of conduct that could not be enforced either by legal fiat or through the discipline of the market. Ethical decisions are not always obvious or easy. Ambiguity, incomplete information, points of view and conflicting objectives can make an ethical decision difficult. Ethical decisions are easier to make with written standards, codes of ethics and a well developed decision- making process.

The Law and Ethics Exam is an open book exam containing a variety of questions including True/False, Multiple Choice and short answer case studies written within a three hour time limit.

**道德测试水平测试的目的和内容**

目的是确保通过认证的成员熟悉CTTAM的章程以及规范技术人员以及技师的某些行为;不规范的行为准则对于技术人员或者技师并非有利。任何行业的显著特点是,工作者在任何行业都需要遵循法律的准则约束。道德水平测试是开放性的并非正确错误来衡量,而是多样性选择的。
