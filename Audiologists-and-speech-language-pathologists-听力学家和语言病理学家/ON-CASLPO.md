## 初期实践阶段 (Initial Practice Period) ##

CASLPO’s Initial Practice Period (IPP)会使个人培养符合CASLPO实践标准的必要的能力，并证明他们在安大略省工作的意愿。

IPP最少是六个月，且要在CASLPO普通成员的领导下度过。必须在成为Initial Practice Registrant (IPR) of CASLPO的个人成员的第一个月内向学院提交导师制合同。当他们在度过IPP阶段时，IPRs必须要通过自我评估反映他们的成绩。这些评估是由IPR和他们的导师在IPP期间和IPP结束时完成的。

为了开始IPP阶段并在这段时间获得学分，必须要第一个注册成为CASLPO的初始会员。


在学院还未颁发给你注册证书之前，不能和导师在一起，否则就违背了导师制的要求。
