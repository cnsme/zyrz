### 教育课程评估 Assessment of Course of Study - 飞出国 ###

请注意CDHO不提供非正式评估。通过审核完整的申请资料来确定申请人是否满足当前注册要求。如果申请材料不完整或其中的证明材料不符合要求，该申请将不会被处理。

如果申请人不符合NDHCB考试要求，又想要继续申请注册CDHO，只有其教育课程符合CDHO规定要求的时候，CDHO注册委员会才会考虑批准其申请。因此，申请人必须安排学业课程描述材料原件由毕业院校直接邮寄给CDHO。 同时还需提交以下材料：所有课程的详细描述，在刮牙、压根整平和口腔预防流程上临床实践课程小时数的记录资料以及实践中治疗的病人类型。

CDHO要求申请人能够熟练的使用英语或法语，语言能力将在笔试和临床考试中予以评定。请注意，提交的所有英文或法文材料，必须有官方翻译件。

申请材料和辅助性材料提交后，注册委员会约用3个月时间对学习课程资料进行评估并做出决定。

评估费为250加币，评估成功后，该费用被计入初次注册费证明（ this fee is credited towards the initial certificate of registration fee）。

> Please note the CDHO does not provide informal assessments. Completed applications are reviewed to ascertain whether the applicant meets the current registration requirements. The application will not be processed if completed improperly or if it does not contain the appropriate supporting documentation.
> 
> If an applicant is not eligible to sit the NDHCB examination and wishes to proceed with an application to the CDHO, the application will be referred to the Registration Committee of the CDHO to determine if the applicant’s course of study meets the educational requirements of the CDHO. The applicant must arrange to have an original detailed course description submitted directly to the CDHO from her/his institute of graduation, as well as a detailed description of all the subjects taken within the applicant’s course of study and the number of clinical hours that were actually spent on scaling, root planing and prophylaxis procedures, as well as how many and what types of clients the applicant performed these procedures on during the course of study. The course descriptions must relate to the applicant’s years of study. 
> 
> The CDHO requires an applicant to have reasonable fluency in either English or French. This is assessed informally through the applicant’s ability to successfully complete the written examination(s) and clinical competency assessment. Please note that all documents submitted in languages other than English or French must include official translations. 
> 
> Once a completed application package and the supporting documentation have been submitted, it takes approximately three (3) months for the course of study to be assessed and a decision to be handed down by the Registration Committee. 
> 
> The fee for an assessment is $250.00. If successful, this fee is credited towards the initial certificate of registration fee.

### 对等 Equivalency - 飞出国 ###

注册委员会审核申请人提交的所有资料，以此来确定哪些课程符合牙科卫生员课程要求，从而确定课程对等性。该评估分为4部分（行为科学、生物医学科学、口腔健康科学、口腔卫生理论与实践），包含了课程要求的各个部分内容，将申请人提交的课程材料进行对比确定二者对等性。

如果申请人提交的课程材料与牙科卫生员要求课程不直接相符，这样评估起来比较困难，因为委员会需在其材料中寻找符合牙科卫生员课程要求的部分，例如针对病人的治疗和预防治疗（包含临床实践和牙科卫生护理过程）方面的课程。此外，委员会还将确定申请人课程在口腔卫生教育、健康促进和职业实习方面的覆盖面是否广泛以及是否达到一定的学习深度，从而确定课程对等性。

> To determine equivalency, the Registration Committee reviews all the documentation submitted by an applicant to determine what courses taken by the applicant are relevant to dental hygiene. The process is divided into four (4) sections (behavioural sciences, biomedical sciences, oral health sciences, and dental hygiene theory and practice), which address different required elements of course content and application that must be found within the applicant’s course of study to establish equivalence. It is more difficult to assess courses that were not directly in dental hygiene as the Committee will be reviewing the applicant’s course of study for elements of therapeutic/preventive therapy that include preclinical practice and the dental hygiene process of care with respect to a variety of patients/clients. In addition, the Committee will review the applicant’s course of study to determine if the areas of oral health education, health promotion and professional practice are covered in sufficient scope and depth to ensure equivalency.

### 牙科专业申请人 Applicants Who Graduated in Dentistry - 飞出国 ###

在安大略省注册牙科卫生员一个必须的条件是必须毕业于认可的教育项目或是经CDHO审核后认可为同等学历。安大略省认为口腔卫生是从口腔中独立出来的一个独特保健行业。在这个行业中，在监督环境下接受的训练教育非常重要，是工作经验无法取代的。因此，申请人必须受过牙科卫生教育项目（牙科学历除外），其教育课程才能被认为是认可的牙科卫生对等项目。

多年来，注册委员会已经评估过很多申请人提交的课程材料，他们毕业于很多国家大学牙科专业，例如，孟加拉国、中国、克罗地亚、埃及、香港、印度、伊朗、伊拉克、墨西哥、巴基斯坦、菲律宾、博览、罗马尼亚、叙利亚、美国和南斯拉夫等。虽然委员会成员们承认牙科专业课程与牙科卫生专业课程有重叠部分，但是牙科专业课程几乎都没有关注牙科卫生护理过程。最重要的是，委员会认为审核的课程不能ensure competence in the controlled acts of scaling and root planing relative to the dental hygiene process of care。因此，申请人接受的教育课程不能被认为等同于认可的牙科卫生教育项目，而且申请人不具备参加CDHO证书注册考试的资格。

在申请CDHO注册之前，申请人必须先完成认可的牙科卫生项目。在安大略省，牙科卫生教育机构不接受非全日制学生。因此，申请人必须先参加牙科卫生教育项目，其先前的学历必须得到认可。

任何学前评估或认可都必须由申请人所申请的牙科卫生项目来决定是否符合要求。CDHO对申请人参加的牙科卫生项目的学分无限制要求。

> A non-exemptible requirement for registration as a dental hygienist in Ontario is that an applicant must have graduated from a recognized, accredited dental hygiene program or one considered substantially equivalent by the Registration Committee of the CDHO. In Ontario, dental hygiene is considered a separate and distinct health profession from dentistry. Work experience is not considered a substitute for training in a supervised educational setting. Therefore, unless an applicant has successfully completed a program of study in dental hygiene in addition to her/his degree in dentistry, it is unlikely that the applicant’s course of study would be considered equivalent to a recognized accredited dental hygiene program.
> 
> The Registration Committee has, over the years, reviewed many courses of study received from applicants who graduated in dentistry from Colleges/Universities in Bangladesh, China, Croatia, Egypt, Hong Kong, India, Iran, Iraq, Mexico, Pakistan, Philippines, Poland, Romania, Syria, United States of America, and Yugoslavia. Although the members of the Committee recognized that there was overlap, they noted that only rarely does a program of study in dentistry focus on the dental hygiene process of care. Most importantly, the Committee felt that the courses reviewed did not ensure competence in the controlled acts of scaling and root planing relative to the dental hygiene process of care. Therefore, these applicants’ courses of study were not considered equivalent to a recognized accredited dental hygiene program and the applicants were not eligible to sit the CDHO’s certificate of registration examinations.
> 
> These applicants would be required to complete an approved dental hygiene program prior to re-applying to the CDHO. In Ontario, the educational institutions that teach dental hygiene, do not normally take part-time students. Therefore, it is usually necessary for an applicant to be first accepted into the dental hygiene program where s/he may receive credit for prior learning. Any prior learning assessment or credit would have to be determined by the dental hygiene program to which the applicant applies. The CDHO has no control over the number of credits, if any, that an applicant who applies to a dental hygiene program in Ontario receives for prior learning.

**针对于非认可牙科卫生项目毕业生**

### 教育要求 Educational Requirements - 飞出国 ###

CDHO的职责是确保申请人符合当前安大略省牙科卫生员注册要求。其中一个必须的要求就是，申请人必须毕业于认可的牙科卫生项目或是CDHO认为其学历很大程度上等同于认可的牙科卫生教育项目。

如果加拿大牙科认证委员会或美国牙科认证协会不认可申请人完成的牙科卫生项目（在2015年3月26及以后完成的），这种情况下，申请人是不符合注册要求的。

### 考试 Examinations - 飞出国 ###

**a) 认证笔试 Written Certification Examination**

申请人必须先完成全国牙科卫生认证委员会（NDHCB）考试.申请人需联系NDHCB确定自己是否具备考试资格，地址：1929 Russell Road, Suite 322, Ottawa, Ontario, K1G 4G3，电话：613-260-8156，传真：613-260-8511，邮箱：exam@ndhcb.ca。考试费用和考试日期等信息请在网站上查询：http://www.ndhcb.ca/en/exam_application.php

通常，符合NDHCB笔试要求的申请人都能满足CDHO教育要求。NDHCB与CDHO是分别独立的机构，NDHCB单独对申请人进行评估。

如果申请人不符合NDHCB考试要求，又想要继续申请注册CDHO，只有其教育课程符合CDHO规定要求的时候，CDHO注册委员会才会考虑批准其申请

**b) 临床能力评估 Clinical Competency Evaluation**

申请人成功通过NDHCB笔试后才能参加临床能力评估。

完成NDHCB笔试后，提交一份完整的临床能力评估申请表。请查阅网站上“考试”板块的内容，了解关于临床能力评估的信息。

>

If an applicant answers “Yes” to any of the declaration questions or if concerns are identified as result of the police check, the application may be referred to the Registration Committee. In such cases the applicant is given 30 days to provide additional information.
