## 新不伦瑞克省建筑师协会 Architects' Association of New Brunswick ##

## 新省AANB会员申请 ##

新不伦瑞克省建筑师协会(AANB)有不同等级的会员。AANB的会员没有在新不伦瑞克省的执业权，只有申请人满足协会条例的要求，协会才会颁发执业资格证，申请人才有执业权。此外，临时证或者执业资格证与临时注册适合打算在新不伦瑞克省做项目工作的人。

申请人查看申请步骤和会员费之后，只需要点击会员分类就可以下载申请表。原始的申请表需要转发给AANB并支付相应的费用。申请的提交意味着申请人已经阅读了协会网站上的条例并且同意遵守这些要求。

除了上面的年费，申请程序的处理也需要手续费。每位成员的申请费和执业资格证的费用为$150.00 + HST (19.50) = $169.50。这些费用都是在申请的时候支付。如果你的申请没有通过，不退还费用。

如果你想要了解AANB对会员的要求及执业资格证的详细内容，请通过以下方式与协会联系：inquiries@aanb.org

## 国外学历申请人 - 飞出国 ##


11个省和领地的CALA非常高兴地宣布启动经验丰富的外籍建筑师计划(BEFA).这个项目给在加拿大的外籍建筑师提供了另一条注册建筑师和申请许可证的途径。几年前。建筑行业认为没有一个权威的机构可以评估受过国际培训或国际注册建筑师的资格。

凭借加拿大人力资源和技能开发部的资金支持和加拿大建筑部的支持，CALA已经有了一套公平、简化的程序，它按照泛加拿大实践能力的标准去评估外国建筑工程师的工作经验和能力。

申请包括三个步骤：申请建筑师资格审核，完成在线评估和注册建筑师的面试。

合格标准包括：

- 建筑学历/学位
- 国外建筑师注册/许可证
- 注册后有七年建筑工作经验和执照经验
- 至少有6个月的加拿大建筑相关的工作经验

加拿大建筑认证协会（CACB）已经同意为CALA管理BEFA项目。

> ## Foreign Trained Professionals ##
> 
> CALA program welcomes foreign trained architects
> 
> The eleven provincial and territorial Canadian Architectural Licensing Authorities (CALA), are pleased to announce the launch a program called the new Broadly Experienced Foreign Architects Program (BEFA). This program offers experienced foreign-trained architects an alternative path to registration and licensure in Canada.The architectural profession recognized, several years ago, that it did not have an effective national program in place to assess the qualifications of internationally trained and licensed architects.
> 
> "The architectural community sees great benefits from having internationally trained foreign architects licensed as professionals in Canada. With it come new connections, ideas and perspectives that can only enrich our profession. On behalf of the eleven licensing authorities we would like to thank Minister Finley and her officials at Human Resources and Skill Development Canada for their financial support in the creation of the BEFA program." stated Sheena Sharp, President, Ontario Association of Architects.
> 
> With funding from Human Resources and Skills Development Canada and the support of Architecture Canada, CALA has developed a fair and streamlined program to assess the work experience and competencies of foreign architects against pan-Canadian standards of competency for practice in Canada.
> 
> It is a three-step process, which includes the review of an architect's eligibility to apply, the completion of an on-line assessment tool and an interview with registered architects.
> The eligibility criteria include:
> 
> - an architecture education/degree;
> - registration/licensure as an architect in a foreign jurisdiction;
> - demonstration of seven years' experience of post-registration; licensure experience in architecture, and
> - a minimum of six months of relevant Canadian architectural work experience
> 
> The Canadian Architecture Certification Board (CACB) has agreed to administer the BEFA program for CALA. 
> More information on the BEFA program and the eligibility requirements can be found at www.cacb-ccca.ca/befa
