## About CAPF ##

The College of Alberta Professional Foresters (previously known as the Alberta Registered Professional Foresters Association) has self-regulation status under the Regulated Forestry Profession Act and Regulation.

The College’s primary mandate is “to serve society by regulating, enhancing and providing leadership in the practice of the profession of forestry in the best interests of the public”.

Alberta government delegates this self-governance and today some 750+ members believe in ensuring the competent practice of forestry in Alberta through the regulation of registered practitioners and their conduct.

The Act also regulates forest technologists.
