### Forms and Additional Resources


**Q: What is the difference between a Technician and Technologist?**

Answer:

Technicians and technologists usually work in a team with other professionals. They are usually involved with the **application or adaptation of technology.** Performance as a certified technician or technologist requires the application of principles, methods and techniques appropriate to a field of technology. Practical knowledge of the construction, application, properties, operation and limitations of engineering systems, processes, structures, machinery, devices or materials, is usually required.  

**Technician**

An applied science, information, or engineering technology professional who performs routine technical procedures with occasional direct supervision and who may assume limited responsibility for any decision making process.

Typical activities include testing, troubleshooting, inspection, calibration, design drafting, quality control, maintenance, modeling, data compilation, estimating, sales, surveying, field supervision, technical sales and teaching.

Uses a practical approach based on a detailed understanding of standard methods and techniques in solving technical problems.

Examines assignments, objectives and instructions to select procedures and actions to resolve the assigned problem.

The certified technician designation is **C.Tech.**  

**Technologist**

An applied science, information, or engineering technology professional who is capable of assuming responsibility and exercising independent judgment to perform technical tasks and solve problems in complex technological areas with limited direct supervision.

Typical activities include design, production, marketing, testing, quality control, estimating, surveying, inspection, diagnostic evaluation, supervision, management, technical sales and teaching. Such activities may be carried out in association with other professionals.

Uses an applied approach based on a comprehensive understanding of a specific technology.

Evaluates assignments, determines procedures and implements solutions, schedules work to meet objectives, participates in short- and long-range planning, and may become involved in developing and promoting conceptual change.

May assume managerial or administrative responsibility for a wide range of technical endeavours.

May supervise and coordinate a diverse working group and train less experienced technical and professional staff.

The certified technologist designation is **C.E.T.**

## Transferring from other Provinces ##

As other provincial associations in Canada grant similar designations to Alberta, it is important to note that a designation only has effect within the province in which it was issued. Since designations from various associations currently represent different scopes of practice, individuals who possess designations from another province must apply for a designation transfer.

### How to Apply ###

1. Applicants transferring from another Canadian province must complete an Interprovincial Transfer Form and pay the current transfer fee ($50 + GST).
1. Only regulated membership categories are transferrable between provinces. Applicants will be awarded the corresponding title in use in Alberta.
1. Transfer applicants must be members in good standing in their province of origin before a transfer of membership will be accepted. 
1. Transfer applicants who have written the Professional Practice Exam in their province of origin will not be required to write the PPE for the transfer of their C.Tech. or C.E.T. designation. Transfer applicants who have not written an exam or who are seeking to upgrade from C.Tech. to C.E.T. will be required to write the PPE.

## Internationally-Trained Professionals ##

Internationally-trained professionals follow the same application process as all other applicants. To be certified by ASET, all applicants must meet a minimum national benchmark for education, experience, and professionalism. Visit the Designation Requirements page for further details, including any required additional documents.
 
### English Language Proficiency ###

Applicants are required to demonstrate proficiency in the English language that is sufficient to enable the applicant to responsibly practice the profession. Applicants may satisfy this requirement by providing the results of the following tests for English language competency:

- Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)
- International English Language Testing System (IELTS) 
- Canadian Language Benchmarks (CLB) 
- Canadian Academic English Language Assessment (CAEL) 

The following minimum test scores will be accepted by ASET for the purposes of evaluating English language proficiency:

Applicants who are unable to provide test results may provide ASET with a handwritten letter in which the applicant describes how he or she became competent in the English language. The letter should be at least one page in length (300 words minimum) and should be signed by the applicant's supervisor. The ASET Board of Examiners will review your letter along with comments from your professional references to confirm your English language proficiency.

Applicants who are graduates of an academic program delivered in English are exempt from this requirement.
