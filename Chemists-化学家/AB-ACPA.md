## 阿尔伯塔化学专业协会 ACPA-Association of the Chemical Profession of Alberta - 飞出国 ##

化学与我们的生活息息相关。制药、服装、塑料、石油、食物等，几乎所有东西都会经过化学家之手。化学家在环境监测和治理方面也发挥着重要作用；可通过化学手段确保水质量和空气清新，保护您的健康和安全。

基于各种原因，阿尔伯特省的化学执业活动由阿尔伯特化学专业协会进行监管。只有该协会的注册会员才可以使用专业化学家或受训化学家头衔。这些头衔可以为政府、工业和公众提供保障，确保会员已经满足了教育和工作经验要求。

> Chemistry touches and interacts with every part of our lives. Everything from pharmaceuticals, clothing, plastic, petroleum to the food you eat has probably been created, checked or modified by a chemist. Chemists also play crucial roles in environmental monitoring and remediation, helping to protect your health and safety by ensuring the quality of the water you drink and the purity of the air you breathe.
> 
> For those reasons and many more, the practice of chemistry is regulated by the Province of Alberta through the Association of the Chemical Profession of Alberta (ACPA). Only chemists who are registered members of the ACPA may use the title P.Chem. (Professional Chemist) or C.I.T. (Chemist in Training) as appropriate. These titles provide immediate assurance to government, industry and the public that specific levels of education and experience have been met.
