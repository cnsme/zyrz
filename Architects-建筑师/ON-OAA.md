For more information and helpful resources, visit the OAA Information page for internationally educated professionals.

**Step 1) 教育要求 (Education Requirements)**

在安大略省获得建筑师许可的第一步是获得CACB的教育认证。你的教育必须符合加拿大的教育标准。在移民大加拿大之前，可以联系CACB评估你的学历证书。

在加拿大，每个省和地区都有自己的省或地区的建筑协会，负责批准和监管建筑师。但是，所有的省和地区的建筑业协会，包括安大略的OAA，都有依赖CACB来证实国际化教育的个人的教育。

CACB是负责评估和证实个人学历证书的国家机构，且其在建筑业中获得过专业的学位或学历。所有的加拿大人必须持有由CACB认证的学历,才可以申请任何省份或地区的建筑师协会的许可证。
>
The first step to becoming licensed as an architect in Ontario is to receive certification of your education from the Canadian Architectural Certification Board (CACB). Your education must meet the Canadian Education Standard. You can contact the CACB for assessment of your academic credentials before you immigrate to Canada.
>
In Canada, each province and territory has its own provincial or territorial architectural association responsible for licensing and regulating architects. However, all of the provincial and territorial architectural associations, including Ontario’s OAA, rely on the CACB to certify the education of internationally educated individuals.
>
The CACB is a national body responsible for assessing and certifying the academic credentials of individuals who have professional degrees or diplomas in architecture. All individuals in Canada must have their academic qualifications certified by the CACB before they can apply for licensure with any of the provincial or territorial associations of architects.

开始CACB认证之前，要从CACB网站上下载申请表。为通过邮件收到申请材料，则直接给CACB的地址info@cacb.caor发送邮件联系他们。

必须向CACB提交以下材料进行学历评估：

- 完成针对外国建筑学校毕业生的CACB申请表
- 你所有学历证书的复印件。提交母语版原件的复印件。如果这些文件不是法文版或英文版的，则必须提供一份由你所在的教育机构、律师、公证人或行政长官公证的正式译文。
- 官方的成绩单会证明你每年完成的建筑课程每个学科的分数或学分。由教育机构、律师、公证人或行政长官认证的的复印件也可。如果这些文件不是法文版的，也不是英文版的，则必须提供由发行机构、律师、公证人或行政长官认证的正式的译文。
- 由教育机构提供的描述所有教学计划的的教学安排包括完成的建筑学项目或同等的文件。如果这些文件不是法文版的，也不是英文版的，则必须提供由发行机构、律师、公证人、或行政长官认证的译文。
- 申请费用。CACB Assessment Committee将对你的资料进行审核，判断你的教育是否和加拿大的教育水平相当。 

>To begin your certification with the CACB, download the application form through the CACB website. To receive an application package by mail, email the CACB at info@cacb.caor contact them directly by mail.
>
You must submit the following documents for the CACB academic credentials assessment:
>
- Acompleted CACB application form for graduates of foreign schools of architecture
- Certified copies of all your degrees. Submit copies of original documents in their original language
of instruction. If these documents are in a language other than French or English, you must also provide an official translation certified by your educational institution, a lawyer, a notary, or a commissioner
of oaths
- An official transcript of record would show your grade or standing received in each subject, for each year of the courses of architecture that you have completed. Copies certified by your educational institution, a lawyer, a notary, or a commissioner of oaths are also acceptable. If these documents are in a language other than French or English, you must provide an official translation certified by the emitting institution, a lawyer, a notary, or a commissioner of oaths
- A university calendar describing all programs offered by your educational institution, including the architecture program you completed, or equivalent documentation. If these documents are in a language other than French or English you must provide an official translation certified by the emitting institution, a lawyer, a notary, or a commissioner of oaths
- The application fee. The CACB Assessment Committee will review your documents and determine whether your education is equivalent to the Canadian Education Standard

自CACB收到你的申请、附件和申请费用，得到评估结果至少需要两个月；如果你的申请材料不全的话，耗时会更长。请确保包括所有的必须材料。你将通过邮件收到评估结果。
>
It takes a minimum of two months from the time that CACB receives your completed application， accompanying documents，and the applicable fee, to the time that you receive the results of the assessment. If your application package is incomplete, it will take longer. Please be sure that you include all the necessary documents. You will receive the results of the assessment by mail.

**三种CACB的评估结果(There are three possible outcomes of the CACB assessment):**

1. 如果你的学历符合加拿大教育标准（见以下的步骤2），会给你颁发CACB证书的
2. 为成功的完成CACB建议的课程，可能需要弥补特定课程部分的不足。在步骤2之前，需要完成这些课程（见以下Upgrading Your Academic Qualifications部分）。
3. 你的学历评估可能通不过。你可以申请复审，或者探索以下相关的职业部分。


> 1.A CACB certificate may be issued if your academic qualifications meet the Canadian Education Standard (see Step 2 below)

> 2.You may be required to eliminate deficiencies in particular subject areas by successfully completing courses recommended by the CACB. You will need to complete these courses before you can move to Step 2 in the process (see Upgrading Your Academic Qualifications below)
>
 3.Your academic qualifications may be rejected. You can appeal the decision or explore the related occupations section below

**提高学历 (Upgrading Your Academic Qualifications)**

CACB可能会判定你的学历不符合加拿大的学历水平，要求你学习一些课程以提高你的学历。你可以在加拿大建筑学院其中的学分制项目中，通过Royal Architectural Institute of Canada (RAIC)学习网络课程或教室课程。

请访问CACB网站，了解申请认证的更多信息。

>The CACB may decide that your academic credentials do not meet the Canadian Education Standard and will ask you to take courses to upgrade your qualifications. You can take web‐based courses through the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada (RAIC) or classroom‐based courses at one of the accredited programs at a Canadian University School of Architecture.
>
Visit the CACB website for more information about applying for certification.


**Step 2) 工作经验要求(Experience Requirements)**

一旦经过CACB的认证，就可以申请实习建筑师了。安大略所有的实习建筑师必须完成实习建筑师项目以达到OAA的工作经验的要求。请访问OAA网站，了解关于实习建筑师项目的更多信息。

要成为一名实习建筑师，必须找到一位导师，并且完成Canadian Experience Record Book (CERB)。

所有的由OAA批准的建筑师都有资格成为导师。如果你需要帮助来找到一位导师，请通过OAA网站联系OAA。

>Once you are certified by the CACB, you then apply for appointment as an intern architect with the OAA. All intern architects in Ontario must complete the Intern Architect Program to fulfil the OAA’s work experience requirements. Learn more about the Intern Architect Program at the OAA website.
>
To become an intern architect, you must find an architect who agrees to be your mentor, and you must complete the Canadian Experience Record Book (CERB).
>
All architects licensed by the OAA are eligible to be mentors. If you need help finding a mentor, please contact the OAA through the OAA website.

你的国际工作经验可能会符合工作经验要求。在CERB中记录下所有的除在加拿大和美国之外获得的国际工作经验。你必须完成5600小时的工作经验以达对工作经验的要求。其中，建筑师要在个人的监管和指导下，必须在安大略省工作940个小时，而这些建筑师是由OAA批准的或OAA的退休成员。另外，这940个小时必须在提交申请许可之前的三年内完成。如果你用除在加拿大或美国工作的全部或部分的经验来符合工作经验的要求，则必须参加OAA’s Experience Requirements Committee的面试。
>
Your international work experience may be considered toward the experience requirements. Record in the CERB all your international work experience gained outside of Canada and the U.S. so that it may be considered towards the experience requirements. You must complete 5,600 hours of work experience to fulfil the experience requirements. 
>
Of these hours, 940 hours must be in Ontario in an architectural practice under the personal supervision and direction of an architect licensed by the OAA or a retired member of the OAA. 
Also, these 940 hours must be completed within the three‐year period immediately prior to submitting your Application for Licence. If you use all or some of your experience gained outside of Canada or the U.S. to meet the experience requirements, you must attend an interview with the OAA’s Experience Requirements Committee.

**相关的工作经验 (Related Work Experience) - 飞出国**

在没有得到CACB认证和没有OAA委任实习建筑师的情况下，可以在安大略的建筑工作室工作，但是只能在OAA批准的建筑师的监管和指导下工作。但是，如果你打算用这些工作经验达到OAA的经验要求，则必须获得CACB的教育认证。然后必须向OAA申请成为一名实习建筑师，找到一位由OAA批准的建筑师担任导师或一名OAA的退休成员，并且在Intern Architect Program Manual规定的时限内提交工作经验计划以备审核。

请访问OAA网站，了解关于OAA’s Intern Architect Program的更多信息。

>You may work in an architectural office in Ontario without having CACB certification and without being appointed as an intern architect with the OAA, but only under the personal supervision and direction of an architect licensed by the OAA who has a Certificate of Practice. 
However, if you plan to use this work experience to fulfill OAA’s experience requirements, you must obtain certification of your education from the CACB. Then you must apply to the OAA to become an intern architect, find a mentor who is an architect licensed by the OAA or a retired member of the OAA, and submit your work experience plan for review within the time frame outlined in the Intern Architect Program Manual.

>Find more information about the OAA’s Intern Architect Program at the OAA website.



**Step 3) 考试 (Examination) - 飞出国**

获得CACB的认证且成为实习建筑师之后，必须完成一次考试。可以选择完成两个考试的其中一个。

- 针对加拿大建筑师的考试(ExAC)-该考试是由Canadian Architectural Licensing Authorities制定的。

- 建筑师注册考试(ARE)-该考试是由建筑注册协会的国家理事会制定的。

>After you have obtained certification from the CACB and become an intern architect, you must write an examination. You can choose to write one of these two examinations:
>
- The Examination for Architects in Canada (ExAC) – this examination was developed by the Canadian Architectural Licensing Authorities
or
- The Architect Registration Examination (ARE) – this examination was developed by the National Council of Architecture Registration Boards

当提交ExAC注册表格时，或在注册前，必须完成并向OAA提交记录在CERB且获得认可的至少2，800小时的工作经验。如果少于2，800小时或OAA认可了工作经验，那么你就不能注册ExAC。为了达到获得ExAC或ARE的资格，就应该联系OAA。OAA的员工会指导你登陆ExAC的网站下载申请表，或者OAA的员工会备一份资格表格，并把这份表格寄送到美国的管理ARE的测试顾问。你必须获得测试的授权才能参加ARE。

>You must complete and submit to the OAA a minimum of 2,800 hours of approved experience recorded in the CERB at the time you submit your ExAC Registration Form, or have submitted this prior to registration. If fewer than 2,800 hours or experience are approved by OAA, you will not be permitted to register for the ExAC. To become eligible to take the ExAC or ARE, you should contact the OAA. OAA staff can direct you to the ExAC website where you can download the application, or OAA staff will prepare an Eligibility Form and forward it to the U.S.‐based test consultants who administer the ARE. You must receive the Authorization to Test before you can take the ARE.

**参加加拿大建筑师考试 (Taking the Examination for Architects in Canada) - 飞出国**

ExAC考试是在多伦多、伦敦、渥太华或萨德伯里每年举办一次的笔试考试。

为了具备参加ExAC考试的资格，必须符合以下条件：

- 必须在OAA有良好的信用；这就意味着现在必须是一名实习建筑师，并非是申诉者或进行纪律程序。
- 当提交ExAC注册表格时，或在注册前，必须完成并向OAA提交记录在CERB且获得认可的至少2，800小时的工作经验。如果少于2，800小时或OAA认可了工作经验，那么你就不能注册ExAC。参加ExAC考试的要求列表请参照ExAC网站上的备考指南，该指南可供下载。

>The ExAC is a paper‐based test offered once a year in Toronto, London, Ottawa, or Sudbury.
>
To be eligible to write the ExAC, you:
>
- Must be “in good standing” with the OAA; this means you must hold current status as an intern architect and not currently be the subject of a complaint or disciplinary proceeding
and
- You must complete and submit to the OAA a minimum of 2,800 hours of approved experience recorded in the CERB at the time of submission of your ExAC Registration Form, or have submitted this prior to registration. If fewer than 2,800 hours of experience are approved by the OAA, you will not be permitted to register for the ExAC. For a listing of all the requirements for taking the ExAC, refer to the downloadable Preparation Guide available on the ExAC website.

**加拿大建筑师考试的结果 (Results of your Examination for Architects in Canada) - 飞出国**
 
考试结果将由OAA通过邮件把成绩单发送给你。ExAC试题每个部分的结果是合格或不合格，你不会收到考试分数或分数比例。为了以防成绩出错，你会收到你需要注意的总体事项的简单回复。

没有成功通过所有考试部分的实习生，必须在下一次的ExAC考试中重新考所有没通过的部分。如果他/她在第一次补考中又没通过考试，那么他/她在下一次ExAC考试中，只有最后一次机会完成所有的不合格的部分。如果实习生在最后一次考试中再次失利，那么他/她就会成为该考试的新的候选人，并且他/她要重新参加ExAC的所有部分的考试。


**请注意：** 如果实习生考试报名了，但是未参加考试，该部分考试视为不合格。

更多信息详见ExAC网站的FAQ部分。
>
The examination results will be mailed to you in the form of a transcript issued by the OAA. The results for each section of the ExAC will be identified as pass or fail. You will not receive a score or a percentage. In the case of a fail score, brief feedback is given to you about the general objectives you may need to focus on. No further details will be provided to you.

>
An Intern who does not successfully complete all the sections of the examination must rewrite all the failed section(s) at the next session of the ExAC. If he/she fails to succeed at this first retaking, he/she will be offered a final attempt to complete all the remaining failed section(s) at the next session of the ExAC. If the Intern fails at this final attempt, he/she will be considered as a new candidate for the examination and he/she will therefore have to rewrite all the sections of the examination.
>
 Please **note**: for an Intern who is registered but is absent at an examination, that section is considered a failure.
>
For more information, see the FAQ section of the ExAC website.
