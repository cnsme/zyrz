## 关于国际学历申请人 ABOUT INTERNATIONAL APPLICANTS - 飞出国 ##

TechNova 是一个进行自我管理的专业化协会，有超过2500名应用科学和工程领域的技师和技术员。很多在TechNova注册的技术专业人士都是在加拿大接受教育，也有很多人是在其他国家接受的初级技术教育。

国际申请人在新斯科特省劳动力市场中占很大比例，且这种趋势会持续到将来。当他们想要移居到加拿大且在登陆加拿大时，TechNova制定了一个服务框架为他们提供帮助，使他们能够尽快的成为新斯科舍省的劳动力，可以从事技师或技术员这个有意义又有回报的职业。

在NS Government的支持和TechNova工作人员的努力工作下，创建了该网站。

> TechNova is a self-governing professional association of over 2,500 applied science and engineering technologists and technicians. Many of the TechNova-registered Technology Professionals were educated in Canada and many others acquired their primary technology education in another country.
> 
> International Applicants represent a substantial portion of the Nova Scotia work force and this trend will continue into the future. To assist them as they consider relocating to Canada and then upon arrival, TechNova has developed a framework of services designed to assist International Applicants make a quick and sustained transition to the Nova Scotia workforce and build a meaningful and rewarding career as a Technologist or Technician.
> 
> This section of our web site was created through the generous support of the NS Government and the hard work and dedication of TechNova staff and members who volunteered their time in providing input to the overall program.
> 
> We trust you find this section helpful and we hope you find the many services useful as you settle in Nova Scotia. We welcome your feedback on how we might improve this site and make the many services we provide more valuable.

### 申请临时会员的国际申请人 PROVISIONAL MEMBERSHIP FOR INTERNATIONAL APPLICANTS - 飞出国 ###

对于国际申请人而言，该政策可以确保当前的TechNova认证标准得以顺利实施。但是随着加拿大移民的不断增加，申请人也将面临就业挑战。国际申请人必须满足目前所有的学历要求和工作经验要求，才会成为“临时会员”（可以没有1年加拿大工作经验）。

假如满足学历要求和所有的工作经验要求，是加拿大公民，并且提交了加拿大公民或永久居民身份的证明材料，这些申请人可以得到某类别的正式认证(AScT 或CTech)。

但是，这种会员认证是临时的，会根据要求的1年加拿大工作经验的完成情况而变化。临时会员的有效期最少是3年，从注册登记得到批准那天开始算起。在3年的有效期内，临时会员可申请再次分级，转变为正式会员。如果申请人不能将临时会员身份转化，3年后，考试委员会（Board of Examiners）会对申请人的会员身份再次进行评估，并将会员再次进行分级。

在会员有了应用科学技师（AScT）或认证工程技师和应用科学技术员(CTech）的头衔后，“临时（Provisional）”这个字会被标示在他们姓名、头衔的后边，并用括号括起来。例如AScT(Provisional),这个身份会被记录在TechNova的内部数据库中。

临时会员证书会针对他们的身份来具体设计，清晰地标示出“临时”，不同于目前AScT和CTech的正式会员证书。

> This policy is designed to ensure that current TechNova standards of certification are maintained for International Applicants, but also addresses some of the employment challenges applicants face as new immigrants to Canada. The International Applicants will have to meet all the current academic criteria and experience requirements, with 'Provisional Membership' being provided for those who only lack the one year Canadian experience. 
> 
> These applicants would be given full certification, to the appropriate level (AScT or CTech), provided that the individual meets the academic and total experiential requirements required at the time of their application and are a resident of Canada and shall provide proof of Canadian citizenship or landed immigrant status upon request. 
> 
> Their membership certification, however, would be 'Provisional' and contingent on completion of the one year required Canadian experience. These 'Provisional' members would have a maximum period of three years, from the date of their registration approval;  At anytime during the three year period, the 'Provisional' member can apply for reclassification to have their 'Provisional' status upgraded to regular membership. After the three years, their membership status would automatically be required to be reassessed by the Board of Examiners. Such a reassessment could result in the Board reclassifying the individual to Associate, if the expectation is that the individual is unlikely to be able to progress to having the 'Provisional' status removed.
> 
> The 'Provisional' member status would be identified by the member having his/her designation (AScT or CTech) followed by the word 'Provisional' in brackets after their name, i.e. AScT (Provisional) and this status would also be tracked within the internal data base of TechNova.
> 
> Their 'Provisional' membership certificate would be designed specifically for their status, clearly marked as 'Provisional' and be differentiated from the regular membership certificate for current AScT and CTech members.

#### 临时国际申请人不会被授予印章（Stamp）PROVISIONAL INTERNATIONAL APPLICANTS WILL NOT BE ISSUED A STAMP ####

国际申请人必须在注册或认证前完成专业执业考试（提交申请时要求的考试）。考试各部分会交给TechNova，从而对完整性和可接受性进行评估。国际工作经验必须是有效的，且有推荐信证明或认可的证明信。1年的加拿大工作经验必须在合适的认证水平上，且有推荐信证明。委员会可能还会规定国际申请人必须规划在职业方向上的专业化发展或通过语言能力考试。

目前，如果考试委员会不免除的话，AScT注册必须提交一份技术报告，这是学历评估的一部分。技师水平ITPs技术报告也需要在"临时"身份的3年内或临时身份被去除前提交（考试委员会不免除的情况下）。技术报告可以反映申请人的加拿大工作经验方面的情况。

对于ITPs而言，这个过程不会降低目前会员的申请标准。而且可以为雇主确定已符合ASTTBC认可会员的基本标准的潜在员工。

http://www.technova.ca/howtoapply

> The International Applicant will have to complete the professional practice examination that would be required at the time of their application, prior to being certified and registered. The examination module would have to be provided to TechNova for evaluation of completeness and acceptability. Their international work experience would also have to be validated by references that could be directly contacted by TechNova or supported by notarized confirmation letters. The one year of Canadian work experience would also have to be at the appropriate level of certification and supported by appropriate references. Council may also stipulate that International Applicants be required to complete professional development in career orientation or pass a language competency test.
> 
> A technical report is a current requirement for AScT registration, unless waived by the Board of Examiners as part of the academic assessment. Technical reports for technologist level ITPs would also be required, unless previously waived by the Board, to be completed within the 'Provisional' time period of three years and before the 'Provisional' status is removed. The intent is to have the technical report reflect their Canadian experience.
> 
> This process for ITPs in no way degrades our current standards of membership and identifies for employers potential employees who have met the basic standards for ASTTBC certified membership. Employers will be readily able to identify that these individuals lack Canadian experience from their resumes, which employers would require to be supplied during the hiring process, and the 'Provisional' designation.

### 如何申请HOW TO APPLY - 飞出国 ###

申请认证之前，可以先根据技师和技术员水平，对教育资历进行自我评估。方式是将教育成绩（educational outcomes）与[全国技术标准](http://www.cctt.ca/landing_7.asp)中的原则（principles）进行对比。

1年加拿大工作经验必须在认证的适当水平，且有推荐信证明。委员会可能还会规定国际申请人必须规划职业方向上专业化发展或通过语言能力考试。

> Before applying for certification, you can perform a useful self-evaluation of your educational credentials at the Technologist or Technician level by comparing your educational outcomes with those published for your discipline(s) under the [National Technology Benchmarks (NTB)](http://www.cctt.ca/landing_7.asp).
> 
> This collection of "Outcomes" and the accompanying possible prerequisite topics ('Elements of Performance, Such As...'), reflects the profession's view of the topics covered by technology education programs in Canada, to both the Certificate and Diploma of Technology levels. The one year of Canadian work experience would also have to be at the appropriate level of certification and supported by appropriate references. Council may also stipulate that International Applicants be required to complete professional development in career orientation or pass a language competency test.
