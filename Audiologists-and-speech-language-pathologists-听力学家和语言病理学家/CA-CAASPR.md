## CAASPR ##

The Canadian Alliance of Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology Regulators (CAASPR) is the national federation of audiology and speech-language pathology regulators in Canada. As leaders in regulatory issues, members of CAASPR are committed to work collaboratively on matters related to their mandate to protect the public. While regulation occurs at the provincial level, members of CAASPR actively work on development and implementation of national strategies for the advancement of regulatory standards and audiology/speech-language pathology practice in a consistent manner across Canada.
