**EXISTING MEMBERS**

Provisional Membership continues while the remaining membership requirements for Full or Associate Membership are being fulfilled.  Graduates from a Canadian Forestry Accrediatation Board (CFAB) accredited forestry program will undergo the "Accredited Graduate Process" (AGP) towards Full membership.  All other applicants will undergo the "Credential Assessment Process" (CAP) towards Full or Associate membership.

See Chart 2 on [Membership Processes for Provisional Members](http://opfa.ca/sites/default/files/registration/201409%20Membership%20Processes%20for%20Provisional%20Members_Chart%202.pdf) and, the Chart 3 on [Membership Processes after CAP Assessment](http://opfa.ca/sites/default/files/registration/201409%20Membership%20Processes%20after%20CAP%20Assessment_Chart%203.pdf) for more information.

Only Full members or Associate members can apply for Inactive, Non-Resident or Life memberships.

**How to Apply For Provisional Membership:**  Submit a completed Provisional Membership Application Form, the application fee, and resume / curriculim vitae to the OPFA office.  Also arrange for your academic transcript(s) to be sent to the OPFA office directly from your academic institution.  When complete, this application material will be considered by the Registration Committee at their next regularly scheduled meeting, and will usually result in approval as a Provisional Member while you complete the remaining requirements for Full or Associate Membership.

Completed application packages must be received 10 days prior to the Registration Committee meeting date.

All applications must be approved by OPFA’s Registration Committee.  The Registration Committee meets approximately every 2 months.  The candidate will be informed via email when their application is ready for review.  Decisions of the Registration Committee will be communicated usually within 2 weeks of the meeting date.  Any further requirements for membership will be communicated at that time.  When all requirements are met, the Membership Package is prepared and should be received by the new member in approximately 3 to 4 weeks.


**Alternatives to Registration Requirements**

There are no alternatives to registration requirements at this time, however, the Registrar can work with the applicant if they are unable to meet the application documentation requirements.  Applicants that did not graduate from accredited forestry programs, after undergoing the Credential Assessment Process, may continue to fulfill Full membership requirements, or may alternately choose to meet Associate membership requirements.

http://opfa.ca/registration/why-sponsors-are-required

### Why are Sponsors Required? ###

The purpose of the sponsorship process is to provide the Registrar and the Registration Committee with an assessment of whether an applicant has the character, knowledge, skills and experience required to become a Member of the Ontario Professional Foresters Association. 

Members of the OPFA sponsoring a candidate for membership must be in good standing and must have been an Association Member for 2 or more years.  For sponsors qualifying an applicant’s experience from outside the province of Ontario, a Registered Professional Forester (R.P.F.) or a sponsor with equivalent credentials may be used at the discretion of the Registration Committee. In exceptional circumstances, such as when an applicant has not been directly associated with the sponsor for a significant period of the qualifying experience, an R.P.F. may sponsor the applicant if they can:

review the applicants work; and
interview the applicant, and the applicant’s supervisors and colleagues to the extent necessary to confidently express judgments as required of sponsors. The Registration Committee may request clarification or additional information from the sponsors
Sponsors are required for Full and Associate membership applicants.  For details go to Membership Standards.

For more information on the Responsibilities of Sponsor, go to Sponsoring a Candidate for Membership.

http://opfa.ca/sites/default/files/registration/20150512_OPFA%20Criteria%20for%20Relevant%20Experience.pdf

### Criteria for Relevant Experience ### 

**1.0 EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENT**

The OPFA by-laws include the following requirement for membership (Article 11.5 (3) for Full membership and Article 11.6 (3) for Associate membership):

“successful completion of 18 months of progressive, relevant, post-graduation,experience which shall be obtained while holding a Provisional Member category of registration.”

Relevant experience has been required for new members since the OPFA was formed. While the criteria for relevant experience have been refined since professional forestry in Ontario was regulated with the Professional Foresters Act 2000, they remain an important link between the active registered member and the new Provisional member.

**2.0 RATIONALE FOR EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENT**

Forest resources are important to people locally, nationally and internationally. Requirements aimed at protecting societal forest values are set out in legislation, policy and standards.However, these requirements cannot cover every administrative and technical issue that may arise in the practice of forestry. The public relies on the judgment and discretion of OPFA Registered Professional Foresters and Associate Members — who have acquired specialized skills, education and training — to manage and conserve forest resources and the values they contribute to society.

The public has entrusted the practice of forestry to the profession as a self-regulating body and to Full and Associate members as individuals engaging in professional forestry practice. Public confidence and trust is maintained when practitioners are competent and independent, act with integrity (defined by the Code of Ethics and in the Standards of Professional Practice) and are held accountable for their competency and conduct.

Relevant experience under the supervision and/or mentorship of OPFA members provides the following benefits:

- Serves as a means to provide Provisional members with professional guidance and rights to practise under supervision of an active Full or Associate member;
- Supports a mentoring program that counsels new Provisional members in competence, independence, integrity and accountability of practice;
- Provides mechanisms through which Provisional members may be guided in their development towards professionalism;
- Ensures sponsors gain first-hand knowledge of the Provisional member’s capabilities;
- Encourage sponsors to provide advice and direction to Provisional members; and
- Helps Provisional members prepare for registration and professional practice as registered members. 


**3.0 ACCEPTABLE EXPERIENCE**

The OPFA By-laws were revised and approved by Council and confirmed by the membership in  April 2014 to remove the previous “experience while in Ontario” requirement. Under the revised by-laws, acceptable experience is normally gained as a Provisional Member. Subject to the approval of the Registration Committee, mentored relevant professional forestry experience prior to Provisional Membership may be considered.

This guiding document outlines what experience will be considered relevant to professional forestry and to the Ontario work environment. This document is for the use of the Registration Committee, applicants and sponsors, outlining examples of what is considered “relevant” experience to Ontario professional forestry.

The following sub-sections outline the general criteria for experience, examples of acceptable experience and how applicants or Provisional members may request credit for relevant experience attained post-graduation but prior to approval as a Provisional member of the OPFA.

**3.1 General Criteria for Experience (Mandatory; required by all applicants):**

- 18 months experience under the mentorship or supervision of:
  - a) An OPFA member (Full or Associate); or
  - b) a professional forester licensed in another province or country.
- Experience does not have to be consecutive.
- Experience must be under the informal mentorship of your sponsors;
- Working knowledge of one or more of Ontario’s forest regions: the Boreal Forest, the Great Lakes – St. Lawrence Forest, the Carolinian Forest and/or the Urban Forest;
- Experience may be gained anywhere and does not need to be gained exclusively in Ontario or in Canada;
- Experience may result from paid or volunteer work;
- Experience must show progression from the technical level to the professional level;
- Experience must show adherence to the applicable legislative environment. For example, Ontario experience must show adherence of Ontario forest policy, legislation and guidelines if applicable.

**3.2 Examples of Acceptable Professional Forestry Experience and Competencies**

(Examples only; other aspects of professional forestry are acceptable):

Headings correspond to the demonstrable competencies within the national Certification Standards for professional foresters in Canada (2008). Applicants may have experience in one or more of the following:

- Working in the urban forest assessing and influencing the interaction between forests and the developed landscape;

**Standard 2 - Forest to Landscape: Structure, Function and Dynamics**

- Experience in the analysis and management of forest ecosystems;
- Experience in the analysis of urban forests and the interaction between forests and the
developed landscape;

**Standard 3 – Forest Management**

- Experience in forest management, including all elements of forest management
planning;
- Assisting in the preparation of silvicultural prescriptions;

- Self-determine areas of competence in professional forestry;
- Ability to adhere to the OPFA Code of Ethics at all times. 

**3.3 Considerations for Previous Experience to Count towards 18 months:**

According to OPFA by-laws (Articles 11.5 and 11.6):
The Registration Committee may, without lowering the standard:

3.accept for all or part of the experience requirement, relevant experience acquired
outside Ontario, relevant experience acquired while not a Provisional Member, and/or up
to 6 months of relevant post-graduate academic study.
Some applicants that apply for Provisional Membership may already have significant forestryrelated
experience, and have received guidance on the practice of professional forestry and
ethics from Registered Professional Foresters.

The Registration Committee is primarily interested in your experience and mentors within the
past five years. Supervision and/or mentorship of Registered Professional Foresters from other
Canadian provinces or other international jurisdictions will be accepted.

To have the OPFA Registration Committee give consideration for credit for an Applicant’s prior
post-graduation, forestry-related experience, an applicant must make the request in writing
(email, fax or mail are acceptable formats for the request). The following documentation is also
required to support the request:

- Provide a brief written summary of the duration/dates and description of relevant forestry
experience (may be already included in the Applicant’s resume).
- The names of the licensed professional foresters (and their registration numbers if
possible) that either directly supervised you, or informally mentored you, while you
attained this forestry experience. If the professional forester is not from Ontario, then
their province/country of registration is also required.

With the above information, OPFA staff will confirm supervision/mentorship of the applicant with
the identified registered members. The OPFA Registration Committee will then consider the
request at their next regularly scheduled meeting. The applicant will be informed in writing of
the decision of the Registration Committee and if successful, how much (if any) of the required
18 months experience still has to be met while a Provisional member.
A person that has already been approved as OPFA Provisional member may still request
consideration for previous relevant experience by submitting the request and the supporting
documentation as outlined above.
