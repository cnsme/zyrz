## MIT - 飞出国 ## 

MIT 申请表： [http://www.napeg.nt.ca/files/Forms](http://www.napeg.nt.ca/files/Forms%20Library/Application%20for%20Registration%20-%20MIT%20and%20New%20Applicants.pdf)

### 第一部分 概述  - 飞出国 ###

MIT计划对于MIT来说至关重要，因为之后他们会成为专业工程师或者专业地球科学家。该指南旨在介绍MIT计划 —— 一个有组织的MIT计划，专门为NAPEG提供更多的专业会员，不仅能帮助MIT，还能帮助其雇主和导师识别和了解有效培训计划的组成部分，最终，参与该计划的MIT将对专业化知识有一个深刻的了解。
 
认证大学项目工程、地质和地球物理专业的毕业生必须获得至少4年的工作经验才可以申请注册专业人士，但前提是其学历已获得协会BOE认可。BOE进行工作经验审查时，会考虑申请者工作经验的各个方面。由于是公司员工或者其他条件限制，一些申请者可能很难在一段时间内获得必要的工作经验，成为注册专业人士。但是，申请者也可以通过担任几个不同的职位获得必要的工作经验。该指南旨在通过阐明培训计划组成部分以及导师的职责（不断协调计划结构和计划执行）帮助MIT解决这个难题。

该文件涉及到的工作经验主要是为了培养良好的组织能力、良好的判断力以及团队技能这些专业技能。MIT必须通过多种方法获得有关技术理论应用的工作经验，例如数据收集、分析、设计准备与检验等等。MIT还必须获得实地实践工作经验，了解不同学科间的相互依赖关系，认识到工作局限性，应用相关规范，加强技术教育，发展可能的工作关系。此外，该培训计划比较重视学习管理技巧和沟通技巧以及认识到专业实践的社会意义。

该培训计划中导师角色使得MIT乐意参与该计划。这些指南不仅对指导过程进行了相关描述，还针对指导关系的内容和结构提供了相关建议。导师只是一个辅助角色，这就意味着他们负责建议、指导和鼓励MIT；他们必须树立一个专家榜样，充分了解自己的组织，了解行业变化和发展，给MIT提供建议时不采取独裁的方式，给予他们鼓励，致力于发展和维持与他们的良好关系。

经验丰富的专业人士不断向经验不丰富的专业人士传授技能和知识，并负责管理他们，同时不间断专业学习。年轻的专业人士通过参与导师计划将获得一定的技巧，而这些都是只有通过反复实践才可以获得。MIT经过NAPEG注册之后，将继续进行专业实践，直到获得专业工程师或专业地球科学家身份。MIT之所以选择建立这样的关系主要是为了丰富自己的工作经验，所以他们必须虚心接受导师的指导，并积极处理与导师的关系。此外，MIT还应该和导师积极谈论自己的担忧和问题，考虑怎样成为工程师或地球科学家。

以下来源： http://www.napeg.nt.ca/files/Member-in-Training%20Guideline%20-%20Approved%20February%202010.pdf

>## Member-in-Training ## 

>MIT 申请表： [http://www.napeg.nt.ca/files/Forms](http://www.napeg.nt.ca/files/Forms%20Library/Application%20for%20Registration%20-%20MIT%20and%20New%20Applicants.pdf)

>### SECTION 1 SUMMARY  ###

>The Member-in-Training Program represents a significant step in the development of candidates for entry into the professions of Engineering and Geoscience. This guideline is designed to help address the need for a more structured Member-in-Training Program leading to professional membership in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists (NAPEG). It is meant to assist not only the Member-in-Training, but also his or her employer and mentor in identifying and understanding the components of an effective training program. The end result of a Member-in-Training participating in this voluntary program will be a heightened understanding of professionalism. 

>Students graduating in accredited university programs in engineering, geology and geophysics are required to obtain at least four years of work experience before they can be considered for registration as a professional, subject to the acceptance of the candidate's qualifications by the Association's Board of Examiners. In reviewing each candidate, the Board considers assessments based on various aspects of the applicant's work experience. Getting the required work experience to become registered as professionals within a reasonable time frame may be difficult for some applicants due to company personnel and other limitations. In some cases several different positions may be held by the candidate to obtain the required work experience. This guideline seeks to address this issue by clarifying the training program components and the role of the mentor by encouraging more consistency in program structure and delivery.

>The work experience outlined in this document is designed to develop such professional traits as good organization, judgement and the ability to develop team skills. The Member-in-Training needs to gain experience in applying technical theory in various ways such as data collection, analysis, design preparation and testing. Practical experience in conducting work site visits, acknowledging interdependencies between various disciplines, recognizing limitations, applying codes, enhancing technical education and developing working relationships are also required. In addition, learning management techniques, communication skills and an awareness of the social implications of professional practice are important components of this training program.

>This training program incorporates the role of a mentor should the Member-in-Training (MIT) desire to participate in this program. These guidelines describe the mentoring process and make recommendations as to the content and structure of the mentoring relationship. The mentor's role is a complementary one, meant to counsel, guide and inspire the Member-in-Training. The mentor should set an example of professional excellence, have a full understanding of his or her organization, be aware of industry changes and developments, be able to give advice in a non-authoritarian manner, provide encouragement and be committed to making time available to develop and maintain a good
relationship with the MIT. The transfer of skills and knowledge from experienced professionals to relatively less experienced professionals in the organization provides continuity, succession management and continued learning for all involved. Mentoring empowers younger professionals with skills they may traditionally have acquired through trial and error. The MIT will be registered with NAPEG, and be working towards attaining their Professional Engineering (P Eng) or Professional Geoscience (P Geo) status. An individual embarks into this relationship in order to enrich his or her experience as an MIT. He/She will have to be open to the mentor’s input and participate actively in the mentoring relationship. The Member-in-Training should discuss freely concerns and issues with the mentor, and input thoughts for his or her future as an engineer or geoscientist. 

>### SECTION 2  REGISTRATION ###


>#### 2.1 BOARD OF EXAMINERS ####

>Authority for registration of persons as members and licensees is vested in the Board of Examiners appointed by the Council of the Association. NAPEG uses APEGGA's Board of Examiners to appraise academic and experience qualifications of applicants for registration
under their Act.

>The Board consists of Academic Examiners, Experience Examiners and members of the public.

>Academic Examiners: prime responsibility is the assessment of academic qualifications of an applicant but they also have an interest in the suitability of the experience of the applicant.
Experience Examiners: prime responsibility is the assessment of the practical experience of an applicant but they also have an interest in the suitability of academic qualifications of the applicant.

>**ACADEMIC**

>NAPEG's registration requires that applicants must submit documentation for review by APEGGA's Board of Examiners. An applicant's academic qualification may consist of a confirmed degree, with education documentation submitted directly to APEGGA from the institution attended. Registration may also be attained by applicants passing appropriate examinations prescribed by the Board. Engineering programs accredited by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board are considered "approved university programs." As there is no similar accreditation process for geology and geophysics programs, the Board maintains a set of criteria against which qualifications of applicants are assessed. Normally graduates of honours geology and geophysics programs at Canadian universities will satisfy such criteria. 


>**PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE**

>1. When the academic qualifications are met by an acceptable university degree, by passing confirmatory examinations or by passing examinations to make up for deficiencies in the applicant's academic qualifications as determined by the Board of Examiners, at least four years of experience satisfactory to the Board of Examiners is required.
>2. When the academic qualifications of an applicant without a university degree are met by passing examinations prescribed by the Board of Examiners, a total of eight years experience, at least one of which must be obtained subsequent to meeting the academic requirements in engineering, geological or geophysical work satisfactory to the Board of Examiners is required. 

 >**GENERAL**

> The general requirements of the Board of Examiners in addition to the stated academic and practical experience requirements are:

> 1. Completion of an examination in professional practice prescribed by the Board and described in greater detail in Section 2.2.
> 2. In the case of applicants whose native language is not English, satisfactory communication skills in the English language must be demonstrated. This may be done by a Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), alternative tests, or documentation.
> 3. Good character and reputation confirmed by written references acceptable to the Board. 

>#### 2.2 PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE RESPONSIBILITIES ####

>NAPEG requires that applicants write and pass an examination in professional practice set by the Board of Examiners before being granted professional status. The examination is administered four times per year in major centres throughout the territories and by special
consent of the Board, in other centres in North America.

>The examination is specifically designed to address engineers, geologists, and geophysicists and is generally based on the syllabus of the Canadian Council of Professional Engineers (CCPE). The CCPE syllabus has two sections:

>1. Professional Practice  
> Definitions of a profession, ethics. The role of the Engineer, Geologist and Geophysicist in society, public responsibility, discipline. Requirements for registration and practice of engineering, geology and geophysics in the NWT. Occupational Health and Safety, Workers' Compensation.
>2. Law and Professional Liability  
> The meaning of Law. Contracts; formation, grounds upon which a contract may be impeached, interpretation, discharge, breach, specific types. The Engineer, Geologist and Geophysicist as an expert witness. Responsibility and liability of the Engineer, Geologist and Geophysicist. Patents, copyrights, trademarks, industrial design. 


>#### 2.3 PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE EXAMINATION ####

>Specifically, APEGGA has identified the following seven content areas for examination of
applicants:

>-  (1) Engineering, Geological and Geophysical Professions Act of Alberta.
-  (2) Practice of the professions.
-  (3) Agreements, contracts and specifications.
-  (4) Arbitration, expert witness.
-  (5) Patents, trademarks, etc.
-  (6) Duties and liabilities.
-  (7) Occupational Health and Safety; Worker's Compensation. 

>#### 2.4 PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ####

>Membership in NAPEG carries with it the right to practice engineering, geology or geophysics in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. It also imposes the responsibility to practice at a professional level of quality. NAPEG is bound by its Act to establish and maintain standards of skill, care, and professional ethics among its members. The Act places onus of the respective member as well to maintain these standards under the Code of Ethics.

>### SECTION 3 MIT EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENTS  A STRUCTURED PROGRAM ###

>#### 3.1 EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENT - GENERAL ####

> The following sections describe the essential experience requirements to be acquired by the MIT during his or her training period.

> Although many experience elements are interdependent, they are listed individually for brevity.For the sake of clarity, there may be some duplication.

> In the following listing the word "design" is used for brevity. That term includes "the practical application of theory", "study", "approach", "task", "geological and geophysical interpretations" or other similar activities. The allocation shows the relative importance of each major element.The indicated time ranges therefore represent the suggested percentage of the total MIT training period that each major element comprises.

> Certain individual components may need to be supplemented by APEGGA-sponsored courses
and forums. These components are identified with an asterisk (*).

>#### 3.2 APPLICATION OF TECHNICAL THEORY ####

>TIME RANGE (60% - 80%)

> The MIT will gain experience in applying technical theory in the following ways:

> Collecting Information and Data: The MIT will collect information and data relevant to assigned tasks and responsibilities such as applicable user-specified requirements, existing and historical conditions, readings, samples, numeric data, anticipated future conditions, constraints, etc. The information and data collecting process includes personal collecting by the MIT and/or obtaining the required items by other means (e.g. from other persons using available sources and resources).

> Understanding Tasks, Information and Data: The MIT will understand (visualize) assigned tasks and what the related collected information and data represents. He or she will determine the relevance of the information and data through judgement, experience and consultation.

> Analyzing Information and Data: The MIT will (with appropriate assistance - when necessary) analyze the collected information and data that is relevant to assigned tasks and projects, determine the conclusions to be drawn, determine the kind of corrective action to be taken or the extent of designs to be created. This may, for example, require the MIT to determine specific applicable conditions and constraints, the availability of relevant problem-solving technology and programs, the applicability of "Code" requirements, the benefits (including cost benefits), and the economic feasibility considering, when applicable, capital and operating costs, amortization, fixed and variable costs and present value analysis. 


>Selecting Solutions: The MIT will select appropriate solutions based on sound technical judgement.

> Preparing Designs: The MIT will prepare detailed designs using appropriate technical practices, procedures, systems and programs.

> Testing of Designs: The MIT will check designs using sound technical judgement and appropriate practices and procedures.

> Work Site Visits: The MIT will carry out specific tasks at locations (sites) that are associated with his or her assigned responsibilities, or will visit such sites on a periodic basis. Alternately, the MIT will visit sites where work is similar to that associated with his or her assigned responsibilities. This will provide the opportunity to experience the significance of time and quality in the design process and to observe practical applications of designs.

>Interdependencies: The MIT will have the opportunity to observe, and recognize in practice, the interdependence of diverse disciplines and activities in overall systems. This will include the functions and responsibilities of MIT's department and other departments in the employer's organization, information flow, work performance structures, and the importance of systems.

>Recognizing Limitations: The MIT will recognize limiting conditions to designs by observing work in progress at appropriate stages and locations.

>Applying Codes: The MIT will apply statutory and regulatory requirements (Codes) to designs.

>Enhancing Technical Education: The MIT will enhance his or her technical education as it applies to assigned tasks.

>Developing Working Relationships: The MIT will have the opportunity to develop appropriate working relationships with those involved in on-site work and the end use of the work. 

>#### 3.3 MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES ####

### 第四部分 导师计划 ###


#### 4.1 导师计划 - 总括 ####

导师计划致力于专业的全面发展，是导师和MIT的机会，因为他们都能在导师计划中受益。导师计划进行固定组对，每一组其中包括一个拥有丰富工作经验的导师和一个工作经验不丰富的专业人士或MIT。导师教授的核心工作经验包括计划、获得职业目标以及讨论并克服专业与个人挑战。

MIT参与导师计划，可以得到的好处包括：

- 自我发现和进一步制定并实现目标
- 意识到并协商职业与个人障碍
- 进一步意识到组织内的技术与专业期望
- 进一步了解人际技巧和软技巧，最终增强专业联系

导师一般都是经验丰富的专业人士。成为导师的标准包括：

- 是NAPEG注册专业人士，并享有良好声誉;
- 至少有7年的专业实践工作经验;
- 与作为MIT的学科领域相同，或者直接了解工作领域；
- 与MIT不相关.

当不能通过上述方法找到一位合适的导师时，直接监督者可以充当导师。

申请注册时，NAPEG会协助MIT找到一位合适的导师。MIT自己之前找的导师可以成为导师候选人，但最终的导师将由NAPEG决定。NAPEG会员也可以申请参与导师计划。例如，NAPEG工程师或地球科学家，最近迁居了，打算参与导师计划，以适应新的工作环境。
 
MIT可以得到的好处，包括:

- 接受指导
- 问题得到解答
- 可以和专业工程师或专业地球科学家讨论工作之外的内容
- 有一个工作参谋
- 接受有关之前职业的指导
- 开始计划实现将来的专业目标

#### 4.2 导师的职责 ####

导师并不能取代雇主的培训，担任的辅助角色包括指导、建议、训练、刺激、支持、劝告、鼓励和激励，所以是MIT的良师益友。下面对导师的职责进行了明确定义，NAPEG《导师指南》将对其不断扩充：

1. 作为MIT的秘密参谋，帮助他们达到尚未达到的要求；积极的倾听者，和他们进行对话并作出反馈；
2. 为MIT提供下列指导，帮助他们尽快融入工作环境：
	- 如何读懂他人/了解他人/与他人沟通
	- 如何做事
	- 如何处理事情
	- 如何权衡时间压力和工作质量
	- 如何平衡个人时间和工作时间
	- 如何处理干扰
3. 让MIT参与专业和技术实践；
4. （至少每三个月一次）定期监督MIT的实习工作，找出缺陷 - 监督工作应该包括一般性讨论，即不涉及其工作的具体技术方面；导师应该帮助MIT明确并不断发展专业目标；
5. 指导MIT培养非技术性技巧,包括沟通、人际技巧、项目管理、解决问题能力、管理以及交易这些技巧。

导师不能参与MIT的工作，他们只负责鼓励和引导MIT。

#### 4.3 MIT的职责 ####

MIT应该明白一点：自己对与导师的关系投入的多少将直接决定其是否能带来最大效益。导师会根据MIT所传达的工作经验和想法进行针对性的支持和指导。MIT的职责包括：

1. 坦率地讨论问题、想法和担忧
2. 提供有助于讨论的相关工作经验
3. 告知导师自己最近的工作经验或专业成长
4. 有关专业发展机会向导师征求意见
5. 告知导师自己最近培养的非技术性技巧，并有关这些技巧的未来发展向导师寻求指导 

#### 4.4 MIT/导师联系 ####

虽然导师和MIT联系次数不固定，但是建议是至少每三个月联系一次。导师一定要允许MIT畅所欲言，MIT也一定要在需要帮助的时候谋求导师的帮助。

#### 4.5 监督者与导师 ####

监督者和导师是两个不同的角色。监督者负责直接向雇佣者报告MIT工作的情况，但也时不时扮演导师的角色。他们应该以不偏不倚的态度和MIT交流有关道德或职业挑战。

如果雇主无法为MIT安排内部专业技术监督，那么，他应该安排一位注册专业工程师或专业地球科学家，在技术上监督和审查MIT的工作。在这样的情况下，技术监督和导师角色都保持独立。如果在特殊情况下，一个人既担任导师又担任监督者，那么，两种角色必须要明确定义并用文件记录，其中包括安排合理的酬劳。监督者与MIT和雇主的关系必须和导师与MIT的关系区分开，并且，必须符合**道德规范**的要求：“专业工程师和专业地球科学家必须公正、诚信地对待其他专业工程师、专业地球科学家、雇主等等。”

有些公司的内部导师计划与NAPEG导师计划水平相当。**注意：**一定要区分监督者和导师这两个不同的角色，确保MIT可以自由讨论道德问题或职业选择。NAPEG导师计划的目的不是取代公司的内部计划而是为了辅助公司的内部计划。


>### SECTION 4  MENTORING ###


>#### 4.1 MENTORING - GENERAL ####

>Mentoring contributes to the development of well-rounded and successful professionals. This opportunity is afforded to both Mentors and MITs as each receive significant benefit from the relationship. In practice, mentoring is a structured pairing of a professional with greater experience and a member in training or professional with lesser experience. Key experiences to be transmitted include planning and attainment of career goals as well as meeting and surpassing professional and personal challenges. 

>For the MIT, the benefits of engaging in a mentoring relationship include:

>- Personal discovery and improved goal setting and attainment.
- Awareness and negotiation of career and personal obstacles.
- Expanded awareness of technical and professional expectations in organizations.
- Greater knowledge of interpersonal and soft skills and strengthened professional relationships as a result.

>Mentors will be experienced professionals. The criteria to be a mentor are:

>- Professional registration with NAPEG and in good standing;
- At least seven (7) years experience as a professional;
- In the same discipline as the MIT or have direct knowledge of the job scope; and
- Not related to the MIT.

>Although it is not recommended, a direct supervisor may serve as a Mentor, but only if all other avenues to identify a Mentor with the above criteria have been exhausted.

>Upon registration, interested MITs will be invited to work with NAPEG towards selecting a suitable candidate. At this time other potential candidates identified by the MIT will also be considered, with the final pairing being facilitated by NAPEG. This opportunity is also available to any member of NAPEG who may wish to have a mentor. For example engineers or geoscientists who have recently moved north may wish to enter into a mentoring relationship in order to familiarize themselves with their new working environment.  

>The benefits for the Member-in-Training are:

>- Receiving guidance
- Getting questions answered
- Having a professional engineer or professional geoscientist to talk to, out of the
context of work
- Having a sounding board without feeling judged
- Having guidance for the early career years
- Starting to plan a path fulfilling future professional goals 

>#### 4.2 MENTOR'S ROLE ####

>Mentoring does not take the place of the employer's training. It is, in general, a complementary role to help guide, counsel, coach, motivate, support, advise, advocate, inspire and be a role model and a friend for the MIT. The following points define the mentor’s role and will be further expanded in NAPEG’s Mentor Guidelines currently under development:

>1. Be a confidential sounding board for the MIT to express needs and help meet those needs without passing judgement on the MIT. Be an active listener and encourage open dialogue and feedback.
2. Help the MIT assimilate into the working environment by giving guidance on such matters as:
	- How to read/understand/communicate with others.
	- How to get things done.
	- How to sort out situations that have developed.
	- Coping with time pressures versus quality of work.
	- How to balance between personal time and work time.
	- How to manage interruptions.
3. Involve the MIT in professional and technical societies.
4. Regularly monitor the MIT's in-training experience, at least every three months, and identify gaps. Monitoring should involve a general discussion, not specific technical aspects of the MIT's work. The Mentor should work with the MIT towards defining and developing their professional goals.
5. Guide the MIT towards development of non-technical skills such as:
	- Communication
	- Interpersonal skills
	- Project management
	- Problem solving
	- Management
	- Business

>The mentor must not take responsibility, technical or otherwise, for the work of the MIT. The mentor's role is to encourage and guide.

>#### 4.3 CHARACTERISTICS OF A MENTOR ####

>The Member-in-Training should understand that optimizing benefits of the mentoring relationship is dependent on his or her level of dedication to it. The expression of the MIT’s experience and thoughts will allow the mentor to better tailor the support and guidance. The following points define the MIT`s role:

>1. Discuss candidly issues, thoughts and concerns
2. Bring forward pertinent work experiences that will stimulate discussions
3. Update the mentor on recent experiences or professional growth
4. Seek advice regarding Professional Development opportunities from the mentor
5. Update the mentor on development of non-technical skills and seek guidance for future development of those skills 

>#### 4.4 MIT/MENTOR CONTACT ####

>The frequency of the mentor/MIT contacts does not have to be fixed; however, it is recommended that they meet on an informal basis, a minimum of once every three months. The mentor will maintain an open door policy to foster communication and the MIT is encouraged to enlist the mentor's help whenever necessary. 

>#### 4.5 SUPERVISOR AND MENTORING ####

>Distinct from the role of a mentor is the role of the supervisor. The supervisor's role, as it relates to the MIT, remains unchanged from that relative to any other employee who directly reports to him/her. When a supervisor also acts as a mentor they shall remain impartial such that their behaviour is no more or less preferential towards that MIT as it is towards any other employee who directly reports to him/her. They should be able to freely discuss any ethical or career challenges that the MIT has with a balanced point of view.

>When a situation arises where an employer is unable to provide an MIT with “in-house” professional technical  supervision, a contractual arrangement may be made with a registered Professional Engineer or Professional Geoscientist to provide technical supervision and review of the MIT’s work. In such cases it is preferred that the technical supervision and mentoring roles remain separate. If circumstance dictates that the mentor and supervisor are the same person then the roles must be clearly and separately defined and documented,including arrangements for fair remuneration. The relationships (supervisor to MIT and supervisor to employer) must be distinct from the mentor to MIT and must respect the Code of Ethics requirement: “Professional Engineers and Professional Geoscientists shall conduct themselves toward other professional engineers, professional geoscientists, employees and others with fairness and good faith.”

>Some companies have in-house mentoring programs that are comparable to the NAPEG mentoring program. Caution should be used to ensure separation between the roles of supervisor and mentor, as well as ensuring that the MIT is able to freely discuss ethical issues or career choices. The NAPEG mentoring program is not intended to replace or supersede companies’ in-house programs but could be utilized in addition to them. 

#### 4.6 预约导师 ####

MIT经过NAPEG注册之后，可以随时选择导师。他们可以从NAPEG办公处获得一些潜在导师，也可以自己联系符合条件的导师。最终，他们将联系潜在导师，并安排见面双方签订相关协议。具体的指导流程可能会通过双方合同进行相关规定。

北方地区的工作性质会使得MIT和导师由于距离的原因不方便联系彼此。但是，一定要使用恰当的方法维持这样的关系。

#### 4.7 协议书/法定协议 ####

MIT的承诺和特点在很大程度上可以决定是否可以成功得到一位导师的指导，所以，他们应该具备的几个重要特点如下所示：

1. 乐于学习：必须思想开明，乐于提供和接受反馈，善于接受导师的指导。
2. 乐于自我评估：必须乐于不断评估并制定自己的职业目标。
3. 保密：和导师之间的敏感性话题一定要彼此保密。
4. 自信：必须自信地处理、参与和维持与导师的关系。
5. 积极维持和发展与导师的关系：不断探索自己的职业发展，推动与导师的关系。
6. 职业目标：负责制定目标，计划自己的职业；他们应该和导师进行相关讨论，让导师提供一些可以实现职业目标的建议。
7. 负责制定职业目标，计划自己的职业和与导师的关系。 

#### 4.8 执行 ####

1. 整体关系结构与职业目标

一般与导师的关系主要经历开始、指导和结束三个阶段。开始阶段要考虑的因素包括：选择建立导师/MIT关系，决定见面频率与方式，最后关系进展的方式。在这个阶段，MIT和导师都要明确自己的目标，这样双方都会知晓自己想在该过程中收获些什么。尤其MIT的目标一定要相当明确。在导师的帮助下，MIT可以实现短期、中期和长期个人与职业目标。指导阶段是其中最重要的一个阶段，包括长时间定期见面。

结束阶段代表指导协议的终止，一般是MIT实现了目标，可以独立工作，但是有时候协议也会突然终止，其原因包括：工作调动、工作变动、工作职责或其他个人原因。

2. 见面频率与方式

MIT一定要明确并不断调整与导师见面的频率。见面的方式也一定要明确。尽管建议是至少3个月见一次面，但是个人还是可以决定见面的次数，并在接受指导的过程中不断调整见面次数。见面的方式很重要，必须符合MIT个人的需要。最终他们会和导师见面，讨论相关事宜。MIT需要决定自己将怎样发展和导师的关系，他们必须时刻记得自己的最终目标，了解这个过程将最终实现自己和导师的目标。此外，MIT必须不断调整见面的方式。

3. 不断评价与导师的关系和职业目标

无论什么项目都必须确保开展的一切工作都是为了能实现之前制定的目标。定期重新审视并最终决定是否改变这些目标也很重要。

4. 谈论的话题

MIT和导师之间谈论的话题应该包括:

- 评估MIT为实现目标而展开的工作
- MIT面临的个人或职业挑战，包括性格冲突、工程或地球科学行为引发的道德问题和/或工作/生活平衡以及时间管理策略
- 不确定或感兴趣的技术话题
- 社区服务和志愿者工作
- 职业发展、轨迹和机会
- 对社会的专业义务、责任&社会意义
- 软技能或非技术性机能
 
5. 避免无效的导师/MIT关系

由于种种原因，导师很可能不能向MIT提供预期的结果。为了避免这类情况发生，MIT最好定期、公开评估关系状态，并讨论任何潜在或存在的问题，他们可以：

- 定期联系导师；
- 交流期望/规则性、方式和技术偏好;
- 交流保密性（通过电子邮件交流时显得更重要）;
- 讨论有计划、有框架;
- 定期审视这段关系（至少3个月一次）;
- 把指导手册作为辅助工具;
- 如果可能的话，亲自到导师的办公室或工作场所拜访;
- 提前制定协议，避免这段关系不能正常发挥作用;

>#### 4.6 MENTOR APPOINTMENT ####

>A mentor can be sought and selected by the MIT at any time after they have registered with NAEPG. They can work with NAPEG’s office to obtain a list of potential mentors, or may choose to find one through personal contact with an individual who meets the criteria as set in 4.1. The MIT will contact and arrange to meet with potential mentors to determine suitability by mutual agreement. The mentoring process may be formalized by a voluntary contract.

>The nature of working in the North is such that it is possible that the MIT and potential mentors may be remote to each other. The relationship is still possible to have, but careful attention will have to be made to the means by which the relationship is maintained. 


>#### 4.7 LETTER AGREEMENT/LEGAL AGREEMENT ####

>The success of a mentoring relationship is determined largely by the commitment and characteristics of the MIT. There are several important characteristics the MIT should foster:

>1. Willingness to learn: The MIT must be open-minded, willing to provide and receive feedback,and be receptive to guidance from the Mentor.
2. Willingness to self-evaluate: The MIT should be willing to re-evaluate and update their careerand mentoring relationship goals as they evolve.
3. Confidentiality: It is important that sensitive topics discussed during the course of the mentoring relationship remain in the confidence of the MIT and the Mentor alone.
4. Self-confidence: The MIT must possess the self-confidence to approach, engage, and maintain the Mentor – MIT relationship.
5. Initiative to maintain and advance the mentoring relationship: The MIT is primarily responsible for driving the mentoring relationship through a continued interest in their personal development.
6. Career goals: The MIT has a responsibility to form goals and plans  for their career; these should be discussed with the mentor so that the mentor can provide input on attaining these goals.
7. 
In addition to those characteristics listed above the MIT has a responsibility to form goals and plans for both their career and the mentoring relationship. Methods for developing and refining these goals are outlined in the following section. 

>#### 4.8 IMPLEMENTATION ####

>1. Overall Relationship Framework and Career Goals

>It is expected that the mentoring relationship will go through three phases: start-up,mentoring, and close out. It is important to determine at the outset how each phase will play out in terms of time, and how to determine when a phase is over. Considerations at the start up include: selection of the mentor/MIT, determining the frequency and structure of meetings, and finally, how the relationship should progress. At this stage, goals should be outlined for both the MIT and the mentor, so it is clear what both participants would like to gain from the mentoring process. In particular, goals for the MIT should be especially clear and well developed. These are the short, mid, and long-term personal and career goals that the MIT wishes to work on with the aid of their mentor. Mentoring represents the most significant phase as it includes regular meetings over an indefinite period. 

>The closeout phase of the relationship represents the planned or unplanned termination of the mentoring agreement. Ideally this occurs as the result of the MIT achieving their goals and naturally achieving independence, however in other cases it may occur more suddenly.Either person may be forced to end the relationship for a variety of reasons including relocation, new employment or employment responsibilities, or, more generally, for personal reasons.

>2. Frequency and Structure of Meetings

>The frequency at which meetings will take place should be determined, and re-evaluated continually. The structure of the meetings should also be determined. While it is recommend that meetings be at least every three months, individual preferences will likely dictate how often meetings should occur. It is important to re-evaluate throughout the mentoring process to determine if meetings should take place more or less frequently. The structure of the meeting is important, and must be tailored to the individuals involved. At opposite ends of the spectrum would be meetings where an agenda is set, and items discussed, versus informal chats about whatever topics happen to come up. The individuals will need to determine how structured the mentor/MIT relationship will be. In setting the structure, it is essential to remember that there is an end goal in mind, and this is the process to ensure that both the MIT and the mentor achieve their goals. As with the rest of the mentoring process, regular re-evaluation of the meeting structure should take place. 

>3. Ongoing Evaluation of the Relationship and Career Goals

>As with any project, constant monitoring should take place to ensure that the goals that were outlined in the start-up phase are being worked towards. It is also important to periodically reconsider those goals to see if perhaps they need to be changed.

>4. Topics of Discussion

>What is discussed between the mentor and the MIT will be left up to the individuals. Thereare however, several areas that should be covered:

>- Evaluate the MIT’s progress in attaining their goals, with a re-focusing if necessary
- Personal or professional challenges faced by the MIT. Examples are numerous but may include discussion of personality conflicts, ethical questions of engineering or geoscience conduct, and/or work/life balance and time management strategies.
- Discussion on technical topics of uncertainty or interest
- Community service and volunteering
- Career progression, trajectory and opportunities
- Professional obligations, duty to society & social implications
- Soft or non-technical skills 

>5. Avoiding Mentor/MIT Relationship Pitfalls

>There are many ways in which a mentoring relationship can fail to provide one or both members with the outcome that they would like. The best way to avoid these problems is to regularly and openly evaluate the state of the relationship and discuss any potential or existing issues. Some points to consider when establishing the mentoring relationship in order to avoid pitfalls are:

>- Set up regular times for contact;
- Discuss expectations/regularity, mode and technology preferences for communication;
- Discuss confidentiality (even more important when communicating via email);
- Have a framework and plan for discussions;
- Regular review of the relationship (at least every three months);
- Use the mentoring guidebook as a support tool (currently under development);
- Where possible, and if opportunity permits, plan a visit to mentor’s office or jobsite;
- Have an agreement beforehand on how you will dissolve the relationship if it is not working
