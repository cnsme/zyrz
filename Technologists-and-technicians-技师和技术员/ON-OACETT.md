## About OACETT ##

The Ontario Association of Certified Engineering Technicians and Technologists (OACETT) is a non-profit, self-governing, professional association of over 24,000 members.

OACETT is Ontario's independent certifying body for engineering and applied science technicians and technologists and confers the designations C.Tech. (Certified Technician) and C.E.T. (Certified Engineering Technologist). These designations are recognized across Canada by employers and other engineering professionals. The A.Sc.T. (Applied Science Technologist) designation is no longer conferred but is still used by some OACETT members.

OACETT promotes the interests of engineering and applied science technicians and technologists in industry, educational institutions, the public and government.

OACETT was incorporated in 1962 and legislated under the Statutes of Ontario by the OACETT Act of 1984. The Act established OACETT as a self-governing body with right to title for its members. Later, the provincial legislature passed the OACETT Act of 1998, a revised act that includes a description of work for technicians and technologists.

## Three and Six Year Certification Rule ##

### Three and Six Year Policy Update ###

In July 2005, OACETT introduced certification timelines for all Associate members to ensure they would continue on to certification. Members were either given three years to certify or six years to certify if further academics were required. In reconfirming the commitment to being an association of certified members, OACETT is making compliance with the certification timelines mandatory beginning January 1, 2016. All members will be given a mandatory certification date after which failure to certify will result in loss of membership with the first enforcement beginning January 2019 for those members given three years to certify. The first enforcement date for members given six years to certify will be January 2022.
 
### How Does This Affect You as a Member Who Joined Prior to 2016 but after July 1, 2005? ###
 
#### Three Year Timeline ####

Members assigned three years to certify from July 1, 2005 through December 31, 2015, must comply with mandatory certification by January 1, 2019. Those not in compliance will be given a six months' grace period to certify or have their membership removed.
 
#### Six Year Timeline: Joined Between July 1, 2005 and December 31, 2013 ####

For members given six years to certify between July 1, 2005 and December 31, 2013, some progression to certification, defined by completing one course or the PPE, must be shown by January 1, 2019. If some progression has been shown, a new compliance date of January 1, 2022 will be assigned to complete the certification program. If no progression has been shown, a six months' grace period to complete the PPE will be given. Once completed, a new compliance date of January 1, 2022 will be assigned. Failure to comply will result in removal of membership.
 
#### Six Year Timeline: Joined Between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2015 ####

For members given six years to certify between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2015, the original compliance dates of 2020 and 2021 will be extended until January 1, 2022. Those not in compliance will be given a six months' grace period to certify or have their membership removed.

## Internationally Educated - Not Living in Canada ##

### Minimum requirements for certification with OACETT are: ###

- Graduation from an equivalent1 program to a 2-or 3-year Ontario post-secondary applied science or engineering technology program.2　
- [OACETT Professional Practice Examination (PPE)](https://www.oacett.org/Membership/Professional-Practice-Exam-and-Seminar/Information-Registration)
- For C.E.T. only:    [Technology Proposal and Report (TR) ](https://www.oacett.org/Membership/Technology-Report-and-Seminar/TR-Guidelines)
- Minimum two years of appropriate level experience (technician or technologist)
- A facility with the working language of the discipline and a facility with the standards, codes and practices of the discipline in which certification is being sought. Normally these are gained by working in Canada for one year.
- Minimum 18 years old and of good character.
- Completion of the certification requirements within 3 or 6 years from date of file review, depending on whether you have been assigned further academic competencies to complete. You will be given a completion date.

### The Road to Certification ###

If you received your adult education outside Canada , currently live outside Canada , and are planning to move to Ontario Canada , these are the steps to certification through OACETT.

You may apply to become an associate member of OACETT before arriving in Ontario or wait until you arrive to do so.  If you wait, make sure you bring all necessary documents with you before leaving your country and then follow the steps in the [Educated Outside Canada and Living in Canada](https://www.oacett.org/New-to-Canada/Internationally-Educated-in-Canada) section.  For those applying from outside of  Canada  these are the steps below:

1. Submit your application to OACETT. Be sure to include the following required documents:

- Copy of a detailed job description (current or previous), signed by your supervisor.
- Copy of a detailed resume.
- Photocopy of your birth certificate or passport.
- Names and email addresses of three professional references who can comment on your work.  List them on your application form.  If possible, one should be your current supervisor.
- Payment of your application fee in Canadian dollars.
- 2. Arrange for your school to send your official post-secondary transcript (including proof of graduation status and subjects and marks) by mail directly to OACETT.  If the original transcripts, diplomas, degrees, certificates and/or abstracts are not in English, English translations must be prepared by a certified member of the Association of Translators and Interpreters of Ontario (ATIO).

3. The Institute of Engineering Technology of Ontario (IETO), OACETT’s certification and registration arm, reviews your application. IETO notifies you by email if you are eligible for membership, and if so, registers you as an associate member and invoices you for the annual membership dues. We will notify you four to six weeks after we receive your application and transcript.

4. As soon as you pay the annual membership dues (in Canadian dollars, reduced dues for those living outside Ontario), we will send your membership card and certificate.  As an associate member, you will now have access to the OACETT members’ area of the website. 

5. When your application is complete and we have received all the other necessary documents:  your resume, job description, transcript(s) and completed references, IETO’s Admissions Committee reviews them to evaluate your academic background and work experience.

To become a certified engineering technologist (C.E.T.) or certified technician (C.Tech.), you must have at least two years of experience in the field or discipline of engineering/applied science technology in which you are seeking registration.  View the [Profiles of a Technician or Technologist](https://www.oacett.org/Membership/Application-Guidelines/Technician-and-Technologist-Profiles) for further information regarding appropriate experience.

You must be able to demonstrate a facility with the working language of the discipline and a facility with the standards, codes and practices of the discipline in which certification is being sought.  Normally you demonstrate this by working in Canada for one of the mandatory two years of experience.

The file review determines if you need any more academic requirements and/or work experience to become a certified member of OACETT.  Please note that this review takes approximately 3 to 4 months after we receive all the documentation listed above. 

6. When the review is finished, IETO will send you a report about the review. Each application is different and to become certified, you may need to complete additional courses and work experience. If needed, we will send you a personalized program that outlines any other steps you need to take.

7. To become certified as either a technician or a technologist, associate members must write and pass the [Professional Practice Examination (PPE)](https://www.oacett.org/Membership/Professional-Practice-Exam-and-Seminar/Information-Registration). Writing the PPE enables you to meet the high professional standards set by your association in the area of ethics and responsibility to the public and your employer. You may write the PPE any time after you join as an associate member.  The PPE may be written outside of Canada with a suitable invigilator.

8. To become certified as a C.E.T. you will need to write a Technology Report (TR). The Technology Report assesses your ability to describe and examine in detail an engineering or applied science problem.  You must submit a proposal for approval before submitting the completed report. The report topic should be appropriate to your experience and employment setting.  You may complete this requirement any time after you become an associate member unless you have further technologist-level academics to complete.  If so, the academics should be completed first.

Occasionally the TR is waived based on higher academics or graduation from an IETO-recognized accredited program.  We will notify you if this is the case in the report we issue after your file review.

The requirements may be achieved while in your home country except for the Canadian experience and can help speed up completion of your certification upon arriving in Ontario.  To keep your membership active with OACETT you must pay your annual membership dues. 

When you do immigrate, send us a photocopy of your Canadian citizenship or landed status papers or permanent resident card (both sides) and update your profile on our website making sure that we have complete contact information for you.  As soon as you have acquired the one year Canadian experience, contact us so we may initiate an experience review.

When the Canadian experience review has been completed and all other requirements for certification have been met, IETO will inform you in writing of your new status as a certified member.  You may not use one of OACETT’s titles until authorized by the Registrar to do so.  We will send you your certificate and publish your name in The Ontario Technologist magazine.

You will then be eligible for all benefits reserved for certified members, including the right to use one of the protected titles, C.E.T. or C.Tech. and to purchase a technology ring and membership stamp.

**Notes**

1 OACETT will review your international academics for equivalency. See item 2 in this document Road to Certification for transcript requirements. OACETT has successfully certified members from many different countries.

2 If you did not graduate from a post-secondary engineering or applied science technology program you may still be able to become an associate member while you work towards meeting the requirements for certification. To become an associate member, you must have:

- A minimum of one year post-secondary technology academics, or
- A combination of relevant academics and significant technology experience greater than ten years

Submit an application for review by OACETT’s Admissions Committee. If you are accepted as an associate member, you will be assigned an academic upgrading program to complete in order to become certified. You can fulfil the assigned list of competencies by:

Taking college courses, or
Taking OACETT technical exams (self-study option), or
Completing a Prior Learning Assessment as determined by the Admissions Committee to provide evidence of knowledge and skills that you learned outside of a formal academic setting.

Regardless of the option you choose, meeting the competencies required for certification will require your commitment. Applicants who are assigned academic upgrading are allowed a maximum of six years to become certified.

If you do not yet have the required academics for certification, or are unsure if you qualify and wish to have a better understanding of what is required to be certified, we recommend completing a self-assessment against the National Technology Benchmarks prior to submitting an application. This will give you a better indication of the competencies required to achieve certification in your discipline at either the technician or technologist level. If you would like to try a self-assessment, please visit the Technology Registrations Canada (TRC) website.

Applicants who do a self-assessment have already completed the first step of the PLAR process. PLAR involves:

- identifying competencies learned outside a formal academic setting
- providing a portfolio of evidence to demonstrate those competencies

https://www.oacett.org/Membership/Application-Guidelines/PLAR
## PLAR ##

If you do not have the full academics for the certification level you are seeking, the admissions committee will assign the missing academic competency(ies) for you to complete. Typically, members take either college courses or OACETT technical exams to achieve this. Another option is available if you have significant technology or applied science experience of more than 10 years and have acquired the necessary learning in a way other than through formal post-secondary courses: Prior Learning Assessment Recognition (PLAR).

PLAR is a process which identifies, assesses and recognizes what a person knows and can do and is based on the premise that significant learning takes place outside of formal academic settings such as work, seminars, volunteer work, community service or self-study. It is not an experience review and credit is only given for learning that can be demonstrated and verified.

PLAR can help you get credit for prior learning so it does not need to be relearned in a formal classroom. It is focused on what you know and you must prepare evidence that the learning has taken place.　

After being identified by our admissions committee as a PLAR candidate, you would have the option of preparing and submitting a PLAR Portfolio instead of the more traditional route of taking college courses or technical exams.

A portfolio is a collection of materials prepared to document and validate a request for recognition of previously acquired learning allowing you to identify and prove your knowledge and skills relative to the missing, required academic competency(ies). PLAR cannot be used to replace mandatory courses such as road construction designation and refresher courses, or the certification requirements for the Professional Practice Exam or Technology Report.

The current fee for a portfolio submission and assessment is $406.85. You must submit the portfolio within one year from time of application. Portfolio assessments take approximately 8 weeks.

For further information and our detailed PLAR Portfolio Guidelines, please contact Camilla Poliah, Manager, Admissions and Certification at cpoliah@oacett.org

## PPE (Professional Practice Exam) Information and Registration ##


### A. Overview ###

As an applicant for C.Tech. or C.E.T. certification, you must pass the professional practice exam (PPE) to ensure awareness of your legal and ethical responsibilities to the public, employers and yourself. Writing the PPE enables you to meet the high professional standards set by your association in the area of ethics and responsibility to the public.

The PPE is a 3 hour, online, on demand, multiple choice exam written with an online proctor from the comfort and convenience of your home or office. The exam is self-study and based on Canadian civil law, the OACETT Act, Bylaw 19, OACETT's Code of Ethics and Rules of Professional Conduct and the IETO Terms of Reference. All of these study materials are included in a convenient eBook that you will be given one year access to when you register for the exam. The eBook can be downloaded and printed. An optional eBook renewal and a CD version are also available.

You may apply to write the exam after you have received your membership number which will be sent to you once your application has been processed. There are three easy steps to signing up for the exam:

1. purchase an exam package
2. register with the [online proctor](http://oacettlive.onlineproctornow.com/)
3. schedule an exam date and time of your choice with the online proctor once you are ready to write.
4. read the [Instructions for Candidates](http://www.oacett.org/getmedia/67d48d70-122e-4c6a-9b87-d426072486c5/Instructions_for_Candidates(New_online_on_demand_PPE).pdf.aspx)

The PPE has three parts: Law, Ethics and Practice. You must pass each section to be successful on the overall exam. If you fail one or more sections, you will need to rewrite the failed section(s) only.

When writing the exam, you will be able to take a short bio break after each part is completed if you need to, although be aware that no extra time will be given for the exam just as if it were held in a classroom.

We recommend approximately two months study time of reasonable intensity (3 nights per week). This will give you plenty of time left in your one year subscription if you happen to fail a section or sections of the exam and need to rewrite. Commit to a regular study schedule based on your own study habits and you should be successful on the exam.

Do not delay. With the exam available on demand there is a convenient date and time for you to write and move closer to certification.

A guide will be prepared listing the texts that you are required to study.   Once you are ready to write the exam, contact OACETT and a date, time and location will be set up. 

To accommodate our members, you can write either at the OACETT office or with an invigilator, at any time throughout the year. 

If you choose to write with an invigilator, the invigilator must be a professional such as a C.E.T., Professional Engineer, or Chartered Accountant. You will be required to supply the contact information for the invigilator so that the exam and instructions can be forwarded to them.
