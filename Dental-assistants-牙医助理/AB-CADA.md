## 注册 REGISTRATION - 飞出国 ##

想要在阿尔伯特省从事以下活动并且满足注册要求的个人，必须在CADA注册后，才可以从事以下活动：

（i）直接为公众提供专业化服务；

（ii）协助受监管的成员 （为其提供牙科用具或进行实验室测试）为公众提供服务；

（iii）协助受监管的成员直接为公众提供饮食和营养方面的服务；

（iv）为受监管的成员或受监管专业学生提供受监管职业实践教学；

（v）对那些为公众提供专业服务的受监管的成员进行监管。

受CADA监管的成员必须年持续能力（Continuing Competence）和更新要求（renewal requirements）,才能维持其注册状态。

作为监管机构，CADA负责制定注册要求，同时也负责制定，监督和评估职业标准，包括执业要求、规范、持续能力（continuing competence）和质量保证。完成注册流程后，有权使用“注册牙医助理”、“牙医助理”头衔，或者是其缩写“RDA”和“DA”。目前，个体牙医助理的注册是通过牙医助理注册表进行认证的。

受监管的成员（即注册牙医助理和省级牙医助理）持有一个执业许可证。该职业许可证必须放在其工作场所显而易见的地方，便于检查，同时，还有一个年注册卡，上面标注了他们不具备的职业技能。根据健康职业法案（HPA）注册的牙医助理，必须遵守牙医助理执业标准和道德规范；接受适当教育、培训和工作经验后，从事有能力完成的职责和限制性活动。

注册牙医助理和省级牙医助理必须满足年更新要求（renewal requirements），包括完成要求的职业时间和寻找保持能力水平的学习机会。

健康职业法案（HPA）是一个包罗万象的法律，囊括了阿尔伯特省30多个受监管职业。法案中某些部分的规定适用于所有囊括的职业，包括继续能力项目要求。该项目使这30多个职业的所有受监管成员受到监管机构的监管，然后加入到项目中，对他们的能力进行评估从而保持能力水平-CADA是针对牙医助理的监管机构。

法律中定义的“能力”是指提供专业化服务的过程中具备的内在的知识、技能、行为和批判思维。包括能熟练地进行执业活动，且具备一定的知识、能力，有端正的态度，敏锐的判断力和正确的价值观。旨在确保执业人有高尚的道德和专业知识。

> Registration with CADA is mandatory for all individuals who meet the requirements for registration as a regulated member, and intend to provide one or more of the following: 
> 
> (i) professional services directly to the public;
> 
> (ii) the manufacture of dental appliances or conducting of laboratory tests that are used by other regulated members to provide professional services directly to the public;
> 
> (iii) food and nutrition professional services that are used by other regulated members and individuals to provide services directly to the public;

> 
> CADA is the regulatory body that sets the requirements for registration. CADA also has responsibility for development, monitoring and evaluation of professional standards. This includes such areas as practice requirements, discipline, continuing competence and quality assurance. Completion of the registration process allows the dental assistant to use the titles "registered dental assistant" and "dental assistant" and the initials "RDA" and "DA." Current registration of individual Dental Assistants may be verified at Dental Assistant Registry.
> 
> Regulated members (registered dental assistants and provisional dental assistants) are issued a Practice Permit which must be displayed, or available for inspection, at their place of employment, as well as an annual registration card which confirms the skills they are not legally able to perform. Dental assistants registered under the Health Professions Act (HPA) must adhere to the dental assistants' Standards of Practice and Code of Ethics and only perform those duties and Restricted Activities in which they are competent after proper education, training and experience.
> 
> Registered dental assistants and provisional dental assistants must meet annual renewal requirements which include mandatory practice hours and pursuing learning opportunities to maintain competence.
> 
> The HPA is umbrella legislation affecting over 30 regulated health professions in Alberta. There are certain parts of the legislation that are common to all of these health professions including the requirement for a Continuing Competence Program that ensures all regulated members of any of the health professions are participating in a process of assessing and maintaining their competence in a manner that is monitored by the regulatory body – for dental assistants the College of Alberta Dental Assistants is the regulatory body.
> 
> Competence is defined in the legislation as the knowledge, skills, behaviours and critical judgments inherent in providing professional services. Competence includes being proficient in performing the tasks as well as demonstrating appropriate knowledge, capabilities, skills, attitudes, judgments and values. It seeks to ensure a high level of expertise and appropriate ethics.
