**你想成为加拿大注册专业林业人员吗**

专业林业人员是一个富有挑战性和价值性的职业。加拿大将从来自其他教育背景下的从业者带来的不同的技术和经验中受益。这本手册解释了非认证大学毕业生想要为专业的注册进行教育、培训、和工作经历评估所需要遵从的程序。它适用于海外培训专业人员和加拿大非认证机构申请人。

如果你毕业于加拿大的大学或者学院的非认证林业项目,这本指导手册将会帮助你理解作为注册专业林业人员(简称RPF)你所需要认证的东西。

你当前的教育、培训以及经历会被评估来确定你是否满足注册的要求。这个评估过程由加拿大林业职业协会联盟(简称CFPFA)开发,它是为海外培训申请人和加拿大林业资格鉴定委员会未认可的林业项目的毕业生所设计的。这些评估程序已经被加拿大的各个监管机构所采用。

这本指导手册包括一些附件,这些附件中包括了术语列表。首次使用的术语都超链接到了术语列表,这样读者就可以很快地查到单词或者词组的意思。

**注册专业林业人员**

专业的林业在加拿大的多数省是受管制的职业。在加拿大的英语头衔是“Registered Professional Forester” (简称RPF)。在一些省份作为RPF执业,你必须是那个省当地监管机构的会员。你需要遵从许可管理条例。每个监管机构都有自己的网站,网站包含它管辖区域内林业实习的具体信息。这些监管机构和他们的网站稍后会在指导手册提供。附件一总结了加拿大专业林业的实习。

**评估过程**

评估过程已经被加拿大的每个监管机构所采用。他们通过与加拿大林业职业协会联盟(简称CFPFA)协同工作,采取了一套申请者为了注册需要表现出的基于能力的要求。这些要求被称为认证标准。这些评估程序为加拿大监管机构证实你作为正式认证的RPF的资历、知识、技能和能力(你的竞争力)提供了统一的方法。

**认证标准**
申请人的资历通过七条加拿大专业林业人员执业的认证标准来进行评估。这些标准在CFPFA的网站可以找到。每条标准都通过有相关性能指标的可论证的能力进行了解释:

- 标准一:树木和林分动态
- 标准二:森林景观:结构、功能和动态
- 标准三:森林管理
- 标准四:森林经济与管理
- 标准五:领导技能:沟通能力和批判性推理
- 标准六:信息获取和分析的能力
- 标准七:职业规范与道德规范

**注册要求**

申请人想要注册必须满足以下四个要求:

1. 毕业于四年制的科学学士学位项目或者同等的学力。
2. 证明你满足当前认证标准的能力。
3. 具备了当地知识、职业道德责任感并且满足了良好品格的要求。
4. 具备当地工作的经验或者可接受的类似的经历。

这本指南里面概述的过程是用来评估上面的标准一和标准二。虽然在标准二里面工作经验有助于表现出能力,关于标准三和标准四每个监管机构有他自己的过程。其中一个省监管机构将会在具体的申请过程和费用、工作经验、良好的品格以及当地知识/法律体系要求方面建议和评估申请者。申请者需要联系他们打算工作的地方的监管机构来熟悉这些要求。

## Applicant's Manual ##

### Introduction ###

The following forestry regulatory bodies of the Canadian Federation of Professional Foresters Associations(CFPFA) have guided this process and gratefully acknowledge the support of Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC) for making this project possible:

- Association of British Columbia Forest Professionals
- Association of Registered Professional Foresters of New Brunswick
- Association of Saskatchewan Forestry Professionals

- Ontario Professional Foresters Association
- Registered Professional Foresters Association of Nova Scotia
- Registered Professional Foresters of Newfoundland and Labrador

**Do You Want to be a Registered Professional Forester in Canada?**

Professional forestry is a challenging and rewarding career. Canada will benefit from practitioners who bring diverse skills and experience from other educational backgrounds. This handbook explains the procedures that graduates of nonaccredited universities must follow if they wish to have their education, training, and experience assessed for professional registration. It applies to both foreign-trained professionals and Canadian applicants from non-accredited institutions.

If you graduated from a non-accredited forestry program at a university or college in Canada, then this handbook will help you understand what you need to be recognized as a Registered Professional Forester (RPF).

Your current education, training, and experience will be assessed to determine if you meet the requirements for registration. The assessment procedures have been developed by the Canadian Federation of Professional Foresters Associations (CFPFA) and are designed for both foreign-trained individuals and graduates from forestry programs not accredited by the Canadian Forestry Accreditation Board. These assessment procedures have been adopted by each regulatory body in Canada.

This handbook includes several appendices including a Glossary of terms. The first use of a term is hyperlinked to the glossary so that readers can immediately check the meaning of words or phrases.

**Registered Professional Foresters**

Professional forestry is a regulated profession in most Canadian provinces. The title used in English in Canada is “Registered Professional Forester” (RPF)1  . To be an RPF and practice professional forestry in some provinces, you must be a member of the local regulatory body of that province. You may be responsible for following their licensing regulations.Each regulatory body has a website with specific information about forestry practice within its jurisdiction. The regulatory bodies and their websites are provided later in this handbook. Appendix One summarizes the practice of professional forestry in Canada.

**The assessment process**

The assessment process has been adopted by each of the regulatory bodies in Canada2 . They work collectively through the Canadian Federation of Professional Foresters Associations (CFPFA) and have adopted a common set of competency-based requirements that applicants must demonstrate in order to become registered. These are termed Certification Standards. The assessment procedures provide a consistent method for regulatory bodies across Canada to verify your qualifications, knowledge, skills, and abilities (your competency) for formal recognition as an RPF.

**Certification Standards**

An applicant’s qualifications will be evaluated against seven Certification Standards for the practice of professional forestry in Canada. The Standards are available from the CFPFA website. Each standard is described by demonstrable competencies with related performance indicators:

- Standard 1: Tree and Stand Dynamics
- Standard 2: Forest to Landscape: Structure, Function and Dynamics
- Standard 3: Forest Management
- Standard 4: Economics and Administration of Forestry
- Standard 5: Leadership Skills: Communication and Critical Reasoning
- Standard 6: Information Acquisition and Analysis
- Standard 7: Professionalism and Ethics.

**Registration requirements**

To be considered for registration, applicants must meet the following four requirements:

1. Graduated from a 4-year, science-based baccalaureate degree program, or equivalent.
2. Demonstrate that you meet the competencies of the current Certification Standards.
3. Demonstrate local knowledge and a commitment to professionalism and meet requirements for good character.
4. Have local work experience or acceptable equivalent experience.

The process outlined in this manual is used to assess criteria 1 and 2 above. Although work experience may contribute to demonstrating competencies in criterion 2, each regulatory body has its own processes regarding criteria 3 and 4. One of the provincial regulatory bodies will advise and evaluate applicants regarding their specific application processes and fees, work experience, good character and local knowledge/jurisprudence requirements. Applicants should contact the regulatory body where they plan to work to familiarize themselves with these requirements.

![](http://ww2.sinaimg.cn/mw690/67e2e798gw1ex1vnqiks8j20nf04ht8x.jpg)

图表 1:非认证林业项目申请人专业注册途径

**注册途径**

- 关于完全具备要求的能力的申请者。

技术提升的途径:

- 关于为了执业必须获得额外的能力或者必须升级已有能力的申请者。

- 这个途径涉及技术的升级、继续教育、和/或重新评估。

**没有认证成为候选人的申请者:**

替换职业-对于不合格的申请人或者经过一定努力有可能会合格的申请者,监管机构会在备选职业中给出建议。这种支持的程度各省之间将会是不相同的。

**申请的时间线是什么**

申请者可以在任何时间开始评估过程。潜在的申请人需要一开始就联系省级监管机构来了解程序、要求和下一步的步骤。在预审和申请阶段 [ 1-8 ],你将会被通知具体的省的情况。为避免以后延迟,申请阶段的询问和要求的明确是特别重要的。

监管机构会明确地告知下一评估阶段的截止日期以及明确完成的申请文档需要在什么时候完成递交。

**申请相关的费用**

申请人负责与申请和评估过程相关的一切费用。CFPFA将会把评估成本尽可能降低。支付给CFPFA以及任何监管机构的费用是不可以退还的,并且费用必须在申请文档递交之前支付给当地监管机构。

为了适应评估过程实际产生的费用,评估费用(用加拿大元表示的)也许会随着时间进行调节。

评估费用包括以下:

**1. 评估费用:**

- 评估费:500加币
- 申请的文档递交之前必须完成支付
- 具有针对性的能力再次评估费:200加币
- 只适用于发现你具体的能力不足之后要求再次评估
- 完成再次评估费用:500加币
- 只适用于你发现能力不足之后要求整体的提交的再次评估。

**2. 监管机构费用:**
这些由个人监管机构设置和应用。和你的省级监管机构确认是否这些费用对于你也适用。

- 登记费(是变化的,由监管机构决定)
- 管理费100加币(适用于申请和评估阶段,也适用于差距填充期间监管机构要求的程序工作、管理和再次评估)
- 考试费(是变化的,决定于监管机构是否有注册或者法律知识考试)
- 年度会费和注册费(如监管网站上所公布)

**3. 其他费用**
付给其他机构的费用(如果适用)

- 成绩单和翻译费用(如果适用)
- 证书评估费用
- 填补能力差距费用(例如学费)

**评估费用由谁来支付?**

所有的申请费用和评估费用都由申请者来支付。

**关于语言**
虽然评估过程不涉及语言能力标准或者测试,申请者必须能够完成申请过程,能够与监管机构和评估人员很好地交流,并且满足实习或者工作经历的要求。您具备的预期执业的省份语言能力将会是十分明显的财富。申请文档必须以你申请的地方的监管机构的语言来提交。

请注意监管机构虽然没有明确的语言要求,一定水平的语言和人际交流技巧对于就业是十分重要的。

**我是否有合格的可能?**

申请者也许会有多种多样的教育和专业背景。例如,申请者也许:

1. 是在另一个国家执业的专业人员。
2. 具有与林业相关领域的经验和培训,例如地理信息系统(简称GIS)、野生动物生物学、水文、工程以及其他。
3. 毕业于加拿大非认证林业项目。
4. 毕业于除了加拿大以外的国家的林业项目。
5. 具有满足评估项目要求的充足的教育和相关经验。

简要的申请文件例子在附件二中。

**我什么时候可以进行申请**

你可以在此程序下任何时间认证你的教育和经历。与你希望执业的省的监管机构尽早地联系。

如果你目前在另一个国家的林业行业执业并且打算移民去加拿大,其中的一些完成申请需要的工作可以在去加拿大以前完成。如果你在移民以前开始收集所需文件,包括成绩单、教育相关的文件以及证明材料等,文件的收集就会变得简单一些。

**每年进行两次评估**
申请的截止日期是1月1日和7月1日。在这些日期之前你必须你收到你提交文档的省级监管机构的确认信。

###准备申请###

当你开始申请过程的时候,请遵守下面给出的程序。

![](http://ww3.sinaimg.cn/mw690/67e2e798gw1ewzn2hd532j20w304laaj.jpg)

**访问网站来获取信息、表格和操作手册[1]**

这个网站包括一个简短的介绍性视频、省级监管机构的联系方式和完成申请过程所需要的所有表格。

访问www.cfab.ca/cfpfa-fcafp获取帮助你的申请的基本资料以及数字资料。

**联系你打算执业的省的监管机构[2]**

在加拿大职业的监管是各省的责任。以联系你打算执业的省的监管机构作为开始。网站的交互式地图可以对此有帮助。

如果你打算在不止一个省执业,和每个监管机构对此进行讨论。你会被分配给一个"带头的"监管机构在申请和评估过程中指导你。你只需要支付一次评估费用。但是,你必须随后在你打算执业的每个省注册和支付费用。

当你联系的时候必须确保:

- 与监管机构简单地讨论一下你的资格、能力和评估过程。
- 对将与评估一起产生的登记和/或注册过程有一个了解。
- 询问监管机构考虑到你的资格、经历以及职业目标,这个过程是否适合你。
- 保证联系人回答你的问题。例如,如果你没有至少四年的科学学士学位或者同等的学位,监管机构也许会给出建议认为这个评估过程对你是不理想的。


**完成自我评估模型**

自我评估模型列出了要求的认证标准、显著能力和业绩等指标。这个模型将会帮助你确认你的能力。它也会帮助你确认这些能力的一些重要证明。这个模型指出了被认可的林业项目的毕业生满足认证要求需要具备的显著的能力。认证标准提供了更多关于标准、显著能力和业绩等每个指标的信息。

一个自我评估模型样本在申请网站可以找到,它对具体要求的水平进行了举例。

不要用缩写或者林业术语。写清楚会表现出专业化并且保证了评估人员明白你的证明的种类和程度。

完成自我评估模型将会让申请人了解他们满足能力要求的程度。完成自我评估模型之后,正如下面保证人部分所描述的一样,你必须让保证人在你的文档上签字。

**语言技巧**

注意模型里采用的描述每个指标和能力的语言。每个性能指标里所用的词汇表明了要求的能力。这些词汇帮助你决定是否你的技能和知识满足指标。一些任务需要不同的业绩水平。一些要求知识或者理解能力但是其他的要求更高水平的能力,例如应用能力、分析能力或者综合能力。更高水平的能力要求将会是能力领域内产品或者活动的评估。关于你描述你的个人能力水平和技能可能会用到的词汇列表请参看附件三里的布鲁姆分类学。

**筛选和收集监管机构的反馈 [4]**

和监管机构讨论之后,你应该对你作为专业林业人员的资历认证和最终注册的潜在可能性有一个清楚的了解。如果你决定继续,监管机构会指导你在线申请材料的准备。监管机构也会解释关于格式、截止日期、费用结构或者具体的省要求细节。好好利用他们的专业来尽可能地弄清楚。


**收集自我评估模型引用的支持性文档[5]**

证明需要简洁、准确和完整。在自我评估模型E栏里提供解释来更准确地证明你所列举的证明显示了你的能力。证明对于每一位申请人来说都是特殊的,所以你可能会有额外的或者适合的项目。

收集自我评估模式引用的额外的文档。根据附件七的文件命名协议,这些文档必须是数字形式。支持性文件包括但不限于以下的文档:

- 演示或者研讨会安排和/或表明你出示或者提供材料的记录。
- 野外营地课程概要。
- 专业的工作成果文档,例如林业发展计划、社区火灾保护计划、害虫防治计划、管理计划、土地使用计划、森林管理计划、提案申请、最终项目报告或者其他、建议书(你准备的投标报价书或者提案申请)、你开发或者交付的培训材料、专业发展计划、来自你的雇主/管理者的专业发展评论以及自我学习和考试的概要。

收集证明文档需要一定的时间和精力,给你自己充足的的时间去做好这一部分工作。

评估人和监管机构评估你的材料也需要一定的精力。确保你的证明足够证实你的能力,但是不要多余。一份证明可能会用来显示多种能力。

以下是完成你的文档所需要的其他文件材料的一个总结。

**选择证明的技巧**

你需要提供尽可能多的相关证明来描述你的才能。不要提供错误或者多余的材料。相反,仅提供那些展现你满足能力要求的信息。例如,你可能选取一项课程来给你提供基础知识但是把知识应用到了工作中从而在这项能力的实际施行上更称职。记住,评估人在评估能力的时候给予了教育和经历同样的权重。提供学术信息(当前课程的概括的超链接是十分有帮助的)。工作经历、工作描述、工作成果描述或者其他工作相关的文档会帮助体现你的才能。模型里的每一项能力交叉引用你的个人简历、成绩单、课程概述和其他支持性文档里提供的证明。在引用你的个人简历的时候会使用特殊的行号,而不是"21-43行"。你需要提供令人信服的证明来显示你可以应用你获得的知识来履行你所描述的义务和责任。

**证人**

要求两个类型的证人在你的文档上面签字。第一类是品德信誉见证人,他们可以证明申请人的品格和声誉。需要三个证人。第二类证人被称作能力的证人,他们可以证明你执行在自我评估模型里面定义的指标和能力的才能。每个经过以经验为基础的证明(也就是说,不是经过课程或者课程概要验证而是经过工作或者志愿服务经验)验证的性能指标需要至少一位能力的证人在上面签字。当教育的文档是不可用的(因为监管机构定义的可接受的原因),能力的证人需要在基于教育的能力证明上面签字。

证人也许会扮演品格证人和能力证人两个角色。理想的证人是注册的专业林业人员/林业工程师或者其他国家的同等的林业专业人员。证人也可以来自其他行业。但是,能力的证人必须必须对他/她所证明的能力很熟悉。举例来说,一位地质学家并不是在与创建森林管理计划相关的能力的文档上签字的理想的证人,虽然这位地质学家在准备这个计划的某些部分是有才能的。证人不能是配偶或者家庭成员。证人必须完成保密的证人反馈表格然后直接提供给监管机构。而且,他们必须审核自我评估模型并且为相关性能指标签字。如果证人不能提供完整的表格,你将会收到通知你的申请是不完整的,评估直至要求的证人反馈表格提供之前是不会开始的。


**为官方成绩单和认证的翻译做准备**

你需要尽快地索要官方的学术成绩单,尤其是如果你在从加拿大以外的机构收集文件。管理官方文档请求是复杂和耗费时间的。所有的文件必须是监管机构的语言,而且必须由颁发机构和/或认证翻译人员直接寄送给监管机构。你负责支付任何成绩单和/或翻译的费用。成绩单翻译成英语或者法语的翻译工作必须由监管机构认可的翻译人员来完成。如果你的文件需要翻译,你必须安排监管机构来翻译。这将会保证翻译人员是合格的。如果你的监管机构已经有了你的记录存档的官方成绩单,你就不需要再去提供一份复印件。

加拿大以外的机构颁发的学位必须由一个公认的评估服务机构为了学历对等(而不是内容)进行评估。你的监管机构会建议你可以使用的服务,例如国际证书评估服务(简称ICES),世界教育服务(简称WES)和多伦多大学评估服务。

**项目和课程概要**

你在为成绩单联系机构的同时,你需要获得课程和项目描述概要。如果你几年之前毕业并且已经没有你自己的课程信息,这是尤其重要的。如果机构有在线资源来记录过去的课程内容,提供在线信息的链接也是可以的。请注意可获得的课程概要的种类是有很大的不同的。附件八提供了三个例子。前两个是可以接受的,因为它们是详细和真实的。第三个是不可接受的,因为它过于简略。

在极少数情况下,因为他们的移民状态(例如,难民)或者因为他们完成学业的国家的社会和政治环境,一些申请人可能不能够提供描述他们学历背景的成绩单或者是文件。在这种情况下,申请者需要和监管机构沟通提供誓词来代替成绩单。

**创建最新的简历(简称CV)**

大致翻译成生活课程的简历对一个人的生活和资历提供了一份概览。一份简历并不仅仅是一份个人简历;简历详细阐述了你的职责、你的职责/专业化的水平以及这些活动所涉及的时间段。简历需要详细阐述你在加拿大和国外的生平经历,包括以下信息:教育、工作经历、专业组织的会员资格、志愿活动、社区活动参与、继续教育以及专业的项目和领导能力。

在一个Word文档里插入行号,选择:文件、页面设置、布局、添加行号、连续的。在Windows Vista Word里选择:页面布局、行号、连续的。

你的简历会被用来评估你的专业化的水平和工作经历来确定是否充分显示了你的能力。因为这个原因,你在记录你的经历的时候需要做到准确和完整。当选择语言准确地描述你自己的能力的时候需要做到真诚。在你所有的申请材料中请避免缩写的使用。评估人来自整个加拿大,而且林业术语因不同的管辖区域而不同。如果你使用了缩略词,请在在第一次使用的时候对每个词定义。你的简历会在在我评估模型中交叉引用。请使用行号。研究附件六中样本简历的建议格式。

**写申请人声明**

申请人声明是一份倡导你的才能和认证的签署文件。它让评估人和监管机构对你的专业能力有一个大体了解。更重要的是这份声明给你一个机会去写关于为什么你认为自己应该被考虑注册为RPF的个人信息。你申请中的其它文档和证明大部分以要点形式出现。这份声明需要你谨慎去写,提供坚实的理论基础。声明多于两页,单倍行距。请不要单纯地重复你的简历。

你必须在声明上签字并且注明日期,在你的申请文档中需要包含一份电子版本。在你的签名上边你也必须包含以下句子:“我明白在申请中做虚假或者误导性声明会被认为失职。这样的声明一旦发现可能会导致从评估过程中除名、评估费用的损失”。

**申请文档中需要包含以下项目:**

- 评估提交表,包括完整的申请材料清单
- 最新的简历(简称CV)
- 完成的申请人声明(参照附件五)
- 教育机构出具的成绩单
- 按省监管机构的要求将成绩单翻译成英语或者法语
- 课程概要,有自我评估模型中认证的课程的完整的具体信息和必要的翻译
- 由独立的和认可的第三方完成的正式证书评估
- 完整的自我评估模型,包括证明申请人自我评估有效性的证人的签字
- 完整的能力和品格证人反馈表格

> ### Preparing to Apply ###
> 
> Follow the steps outlined below when you begin the application process. 
> 
> ![](http://ww3.sinaimg.cn/mw690/67e2e798gw1ewzn2hd532j20w304laaj.jpg)
> 
> **Visit the website for information, forms and procedures [1]**.
> 
> This website includes a brief introductory video, contact information for the provincial regulatory bodies and all of the forms required to complete the application process
> 
> 
> See www.cfab.ca/cfpfa-fcafp for general information as well as digital materials that will help you with
> your application

> **Contact the regulatory body in the province where you plan to practice [2]**
> 
> Regulation of professions is a provincial responsibility in Canada. Begin by contacting the regulatory body in the province where you plan to practice. The website has an interactive map to assist with this.
> 
> If you plan on practicing in more than one province, discuss this with each of the regulatory bodies. You will be assigned a “lead” regulatory body that will guide you through the application and assessment process. You will only pay the assessment fee once. However, you must subsequently register in each province where you intend to practice and pay fees in each
> 
> When you make contact be sure to:
> 
> - Briefly discuss your qualifications, competencies, and the assessment process with the regulatory body.
> - Get an understanding of the enrolment and / or registration process that will occur along with the assessment.
> - Ask the regulatory body if this process is appropriate given your qualifications, experience, and career goals.
> - Ensure the contact person responds to your questions. For example, if you do not have at least a four-year,
> science-based baccalaureate degree or equivalent, the regulatory body might advise that this assessment
> process is likely not ideal for you
> 
> **Complete the self-assessment matrix [3]**
> 
> The Self-Assessment Matrix lists the required certification standards, demonstrable competencies and performance indicators. The matrix will help you identify your competencies. It also helps you to identify key pieces of evidence as proof of these competencies. The matrix outlines the demonstrable competencies that graduates from an accredited forestry program must have to meet the certification requirements. The Certification Standards provide more information on each standard, demonstrable competency, and performance indicator
> 
> 
> A sample self-assessment matrix is provided on the applicant website to give an example of the level of detail required.
> 
> Do not use acronyms or forestry jargon. Writing clearly will demonstrate professionalism and ensure that assessors understand the type and extent of your evidence.
> 
> Completing the self-assessment matrix will allow applicants to understand the degree to which they meet the competency requirements. After completing the matrix, you must have witnesses to sign on your portfolio, as described below in the Witness section.
> 
> **Language Tip**
> 
> Be aware of the language used in the matrix to describe each indicator and competency. The verb used in each performance indicator indicates the type of competency required. The verb helps you decide if your skills and knowledge meet the indicator. Certain tasks require different levels of performance. Some require knowledge or comprehension while others require higher levels of performance such as application, analysis, or synthesis. A higher ability requirement would be the evaluation of products or activities within a competency area. For a list of verbs you may use to describe your own competency level and abilities, see Blooms Taxonomy in Appendix Three. 
> 
> **Pre-screen and gather feedback from the regulatory body [4].**
> 
> After talking with the regulatory body, you should have a clear understanding of your potential for credential recognition and eventual registration as a professional forester. Should you decide to proceed, the regulatory body will direct you to the online application materials. The regulatory body will also explain details about format, timelines, fee structures, or specific provincial requirements. Take advantage of their expertise to clarify as much as possible.
> 
> **Assemble supporting documents referenced in the Self-Assessment Matrix [5].**
> 
> Evidence should be concise, authentic, and integrated. Provide explanations in Column E of the Self-Assessment Matrix to clarify exactly how the evidence you cite demonstrates your competency.Evidence is unique to each applicant, so you may have additional and appropriate items.
> 
> Assemble additional supporting documents that are referenced in the Self-Assessment Matrix. These documents must be in digital format according to the File Naming Protocol in Appendix 7. Supporting documents may include, but are not limited to, the following:
> 
> - Presentation or workshop agendas and or minutes indicating that you attended or presented the material.
> - Field camp course outlines.
> - Portfolio of professional work products such as: forest development plans, community wildfire protection plans,pest management plans, stewardship plans, land use plans, forest management plans, requests for proposals, final project reports, or others, proposals (bid proposals or requests for proposals that you prepared), training materials that you developed or delivered, professional development plans. professional development reviews from your employers/supervisors, outlines of self-study and challenge exams.
> 
> Gathering evidence material will require significant time and effort. Give yourself enough time to do this part well. 
> 
> Assessing your material will also require significant effort by the assessors and regulatory bodies. Make sure that your evidence is adequate to demonstrate your competency, but not excessive. One article of evidence may be used to demonstrate more than one competency.
> 
> Here is a summary of the other documentation required to complete your portfolio
> 
> **Tips for Selecting Evidence:**
> 
> You should provide as much relevant evidence as possible to describe your abilities. Do not provide fluff or superfluous material. Instead, provide only that information that show how you meet each competency. For example, you might have taken a course to provide you with the basic knowledge but have applied that knowledge on the job to become more competent in your performance of that competency. Remember that when assessors evaluate competency equal weighting is given to education and experience. Provide academic information (hyperlinks to current course outlines are helpful).Include work experience, job descriptions, work product descriptions, or other work-related documents that will help demonstrate your abilities. For each competency in the matrix cross-reference the evidence provided in your curriculum vitae, transcripts, course outlines, and other supporting documents. In cross referencing with your CV, use specific line numbers, not “lines 21-43”. You should provide evidence that demonstrates convincingly that you are capable of using the knowledge you have gained to perform the duties and responsibilities described.
> 
> **Witnesses**
> 
> Two types of witnesses are required to sign on your portfolio. The first is a character witness who can attest to the character and repute of an applicant. Three character witnesses are required. The second type of witness, called a competency witness, is one who can attest to your ability to perform the indicators and demonstrable competencies defined in the Self-Assessment Matrix. Each performance indicator that is validated with experience-based evidence (i.e., not validated by a course or course outline but instead by work or volunteer experience) is to be signed-on by at least one competency witness. When documentation for education is not available (for acceptable reasons as defined by the regulatory body) competency witnesses may also sign-o" on evidence for education-based competencies. You are likely to have several competency witnesses.
> 
> Witnesses may act as both character and competency witnesses. Ideal witnesses are registered professional foresters/ ingénieurs forestiers or the equivalent forest professionals in other countries. Witnesses may come from other professions as well. However, a competency witness must be familiar with the competency for which he/she is attesting. For example, a professional geologist is not the ideal witness to sign-o" on a competency related to creating a forest management plan, although the geologist may have abilities in preparing certain parts of the plan. Witnesses should not be spouses or family members. Witnesses must complete the confidential Witness Feedback Form and provide it directly to the regulatory body. In addition they must review your Self-Assessment Matrix and initial the relevant performance indicators. If witnesses fail to provide completed forms, you will be informed that your application is incomplete and the assessment will not begin until the required Witness Feedback Forms are provided.
> 
> **Arrange for official transcripts and certified translations**
> 
> You should request offcial academic transcripts as soon as possible, especially if you are seeking documents from institutions outside Canada. Managing offcial document requests can be complicated and time consuming. All documents must be in the language of the regulatory body and must be sent directly to the regulatory body by the issuing institution and/or certified translator. You are responsible to pay any fees for transcripts and/or translations.Translations of transcripts into English or French must be done by a translator approved by the regulatory body. If your documents require translation, you must arrange for that translation with the regulatory body. This will ensure translators are appropriate. If your regulatory body already has your official transcripts on file, you are not required to provide a duplicate copy.
> 
> Degrees from institutions outside Canada must also be assessed for degree equivalency (not content) by a recognized assessment service. Your regulatory body will advise you on which services may be used, such as: International Credential Evaluation Services (ICES), World Education Services (WES), and University of Toronto Evaluation Service.
> 
> **Program and Course Outlines**
> 
> At the same time that you contact institutions for transcripts, you are advised to also obtain course and program description outlines. This may be especially important if you graduated several years ago and no longer have your own course information. If the institution has online resources to document past course content, providing links to the online information is encouraged. Note that there are significant differences in the type of course outline available. Appendix 8 provides 3 examples. The first 2 are acceptable because they are detailed and substantive. The third is unacceptable because it is too brief.
> 
> In very rare circumstances, some applicants may not be able to arrange for transcripts or documents describing their academic history because of their circumstances upon immigration (e.g., refugees) or because of the social and political climate in the country where studies were completed. In such cases, applicants should discuss with the regulatory body providing sworn statements in lieu of transcripts .
> 
> **Create an up-to-date curriculum vitae (CV)**
> 
> Loosely translated as course of life, a CV provides an overview of a person’s life and qualifications. A CV is more than a resume; a CV details your responsibilities, level of responsibility/professionalism, learning outcomes, and the period during which you were involved in the activities. The CV should detail your life experiences both in Canada and abroad and include information about the following: Education, work experience, membership in professional organizations, volunteer activities, community involvement, continuing education, professional projects and leadership.
> 
> To insert line numbers in a Word document, choose: File, Page Set-Up, Layout, Add Line Numbering, Continuous. In Windows Vista Word, choose: Page Layout, Line Numbers, Continuous. 
> 
> Your CV will be used to evaluate your level of professionalism and work experience to determine if competencies have been adequately demonstrated. For this reason, you should be accurate and thorough in documenting your experience. Be truthful when choosing language to accurately describe your own level of competency. Please avoid the use of acronyms in all your application materials. Assessors come from across Canada and forestry jargon varies by jurisdiction. If you do use acronyms, please define each one at first use. Your CV must be cross-referenced in the Self-Assessment Matrix. Use line numbers. Study the Sample CV in Appendix 6 for a suggested format.

> **Write an Applicant Declaration**
> 
> The Applicant Declaration is a signed document that advocates for your abilities and credentials. It gives the assessors and regulatory body an overview of your professional competence. More importantly this declaration provides an opportunity for you to write a personal message about why you think you should be considered for registration as an RPF.The other documents and evidence in your application appear mostly in point form. This declaration will require careful writing to provide a solid rationale. The declaration will be no more than two pages, single-spaced. Please do not simply repeat your CV. 
> 
> You must sign and date the declaration and include a digital version in your application portfolio. You must also include the following sentence above your signature: “I understand that making false or misleading statements in this application may be considered professional misconduct. Such statements may result in expulsion from the assessment process, loss of assessment fee and, if discovered later, 
> 
> **The following items are required in the application portfolio:**
> 
> - Assessment Submission Form, including completed application checklist
> - Current Curriculum Vitae (CV)
> - Completed Applicant Declaration (see Appendix 5)
> - Transcripts from educational institution(s)
> - Translation of transcripts into English or French as required by the provincial regulatory body
> - Course outlines, with complete detail of courses identified in the Self-Assessment Matrix and necessary translations
> - Formal credential assessment completed by an independent and recognized third party
> - Completed Self-Assessment Matrix including witness signatures attesting to the validity of applicant’s  selfassessments
> - Completed Competency and Character Witness Feedback Forms
> - Fees (as directed by your regulatory body)
> 
> 
> disciplinary action by the regulatory body, up to and including removal from the professional regulatory body.”
> For a Sample Applicant Declaration, see Appendix 4.
> 
> **Build your application portfolio**
> 
> As mentioned, the application process takes significant time and effort. With the exception of original transcripts, translations, and degree assessments that must be sent directly from the issuing institutions to the regulatory body, your entire portfolio must be in digital format. Refer to the File Naming Protocol in Appendix 7.
> 
> Helpful tips for preparing your application portfolio:
> 
> - You may have gained required qualifications, knowledge, skills, and abilities (competencies) from several sources, such as  academic program content, documented work experience and additional continuing education  and workshops;
> - All learning methods will be considered equally, provided that you document how you gained each competency;
> - If you graduated from a non-CFAB-accredited program and have work experience in a field related to forestry, it is important to document the relevance of your work as it relates to professional forestry
> - Although you might have extensive work experience, each regulatory body has their own work experience guidelines, which may limit the amount of relevant foreign or related professional work that can be recognized in Canada.
> - Submit the application portfolio in the language(s) of the regulatory body to which you are applying. Please seek clarification from the regulatory body if this is unclear.
> - Gathering evidence and material to document and demonstrate your competencies will require significant time and effort. Give yourself enough time to do this part well as it can save time and money later on.
> - Even if witnesses sign on specific indicators and demonstrable competencies in your Self-Assessment Matrix,  the assessment may identify competency gaps in these areas if your education or experience is not suffcient.
> 
> **Registrar preRscreens applicant material [6].**
> 
> The Registrar will review your documents for completeness. This is not an assessment of your credentials but rather a review of the content and format. The Registrar may request that you make revisions to this documentation prior to making a formal application.

> 
> ![](http://ww3.sinaimg.cn/mw690/67e2e798gw1ex1wn46689j20r207c0tc.jpg)
> 
> **Application package sent to assessment panel [13]**
> 
> After an application portfolio is deemed adequate for assessment, it will be sent to the assessment panel. Assessment panels meet twice a year to assess applications. At this point, the regulatory body will inform you that the assessment panel may initiate subsequent contact regarding the portfolio if they have questions or require clarification.
> 
> **Assessment panel meets [14]**
> 
> The assessment panel receives the assessment package and all other necessary documents from the regulatory body. The assessors will review all your documentation and evaluate your qualifications, knowledge, skills and abilities as they relate to the demonstrable competencies and certification standards.
> 
> There may also be witness background checks. The goal of the background check is to provide evidence that the witness has adequate knowledge of the applicant’s education and experience relative to the demonstrable competencies as identified in your Self-Assessment Matrix. The process may be formal or informal depending on the assessment panel and the witnesses. If the assessment panel has any concerns about a witness’s ability to sign on the applicant’s submission, the panel leader will discuss this with the regulatory body. The regulatory body may choose to contact the applicant and ask for additional witnesses. If the panel has questions or needs clarification during their evaluation of your package, they will contact you directly
> 
> **Assessment Report submitted [15]**
> 
> After careful review and discussion of your application, the assessment panel completes an assessment report with one of the following set of findings: 
> 
> 1. Your portfolio demonstrates that you adequately meet the demonstrable competencies; or
> 2. Additional information is required. The panel will identify what is missing. The regulatory body then contacts you directly with a request for the required information. Once you provide the additional information, it will be evaluated and your assessment completed; or
> 3. Your portfolio does not adequately demonstrate that you meet the demonstrable competencies. The assessment report identifies the areas of deficiency and suggest appropriate gap filling activities such as training or work experience.
> 
> The assessment panel’s assessment report is considered confidential but may be provided to you on request. The assessment report becomes part of your file with the regulatory body
> 
> **Final applicant interview [16]**
> 
> After receiving the assessment report, the regulatory body conducts a final applicant interview. Your interview may be conducted in person, over the phone, or by using other conferencing tools. The final interview is informal and has no required structure or format. Regulatory bodies may also use the interview to seek clarification on any deficiencies that were identified by the assessment panel.
> 
> The interview is also an opportunity for regulatory bodies to explain the steps to enrolment and / or registration with the provincial body.
> 
> **Competency decision is provided [17]**
> 
> After reviewing your assessment report and conducting the applicant interview the regulatory body makes the registration decision. You will be notified in writing of the decision, including an explanation of that decision, and summary of next steps. If you are found to have all competencies [18c], you may proceed directly to registration process [28].
> 
> Applicants with outstanding learning or experience requirements will receive guidance from the regulatory body about gap-filling or supplemental activities [18a]. Gap filling is described below. 
> 
> If you disagree with the assessment report, you may request either a targeted or a complete reassessment [18b]. The reassessment process is described below
> 
> **How long is my assessment report valid?**
> 
> Your competency assessment is considered valid for five years from the date of the assessment panel’s report. Once you have obtained your RPF status in one province you will be able to transfer your status to a diffierent province without a reassessment
> 
> ![](http://ww1.sinaimg.cn/mw690/67e2e798gw1ex1wn3nnhtj20q706tt9a.jpg)
> 
> 
> In situations where your demonstrable competencies are not adequate, you will be notified and deficiencies will be identified [18a].
> 
> The regulatory body will discuss supplemental activities that can help you to learn or gain experience in the competencies that are lacking. Work with the regulatory body to identify appropriate gap-filling activities that will help you to develop the missing demonstrable competencies [19]. Complete these gap-filling activities and thoroughly document the process to prove that you have gained the missing competencies [20]. Thoroughly describe your activities,the learning outcomes, and any additional relevant information. Keep in regular contact with the Registrar during this time to ensure the work is appropriate and you are following the requirements. The regulatory body will reassess your demonstrable competencies after completion of gap filling activities [21]. Discuss these results with your regulatory body. Once all gaps have been filled, you will advance to registration and enrolment as an RPF.
> 
> You will have five years from the date you are notified of the missing competencies to gain them. 

###再次评估###

如果你不同意评估报告,你可以要求再次评估[24]。这个要求必须是书面形式,必须在收到评估决定的30天内提供给监管机构,必须提出支持再次评估的论点清楚地指出没有列入考虑的证明。通知也必须指出要求的再次评估方法:

**1. 有针对性的能力再次评估[25aR26a]:**

如果你提供支持你的再次评估的新的或者额外的信息,原来的评估小组将会完成有针对性的能力再次评估。再次评估花费200加币并且在提交要求再次评估的书面通知的时候支付。新的或者额外的信息必须在收到原来的书面能力决定起90天内被收到。

**2. 完整的再次评估 [25bR26b]:**

你也许会要求完整的再次评估,提供支持你的申请的额外的信息。一个新的评估小组会被分配来做第二次的能力评估。和原来的评估一样,完整的再次评估的费用是500加币。费用必须在提交要求再次评估的书面通知的时候支付。如果完整的再次评估做出申请者确实具备了所有能力的决定,然后再次评估的费用将会被退还。

再次评估之后你将会尽快收到收到结果的书面通知[27a-b]。

请记住,再次评估也许会发现除原来评估发现的不足之外其他的能力不足,在这种情况下,需要填补差距[27a]。

再次评估的决定就是最终决定。

> ### Reassessment ###
> 
> If you do not agree with the results of the assessment report, you may request a reassessment [24]. This request must be in writing, must be provided to the regulatory body within 30 days of receiving the assessment decision and must present the arguments in support of the reassessment clearly identifying any evidence that may not have been taken into consideration. The notice must also indicate which reassessment method is being requested:
> 
> **1. Targeted Competency Reassessment [25aR26a]:**
> 
> If you supply new or additional information in support of your reassessment, the original assessment panel will complete a targeted competency reassessment. This reassessment costs $200 and must be paid with submission of the written notice requesting reassessment. The new or additional information must be received within 90 days of the original written competency decision;
> 
> **2. Complete Reassessment [25bR26b]:**
> 
> You may also request a complete reassessment, and may provide additional information in support of your application. A new assessment panel will be assembled to do a second competency assessment. The fee for this complete reassessment is $500, the same as the initial assessment. The fee must be paid with submission of the written notice requesting reassessment. If a complete reassessment results in the decision that an applicant does in fact demonstrate all competencies then the reassessment fee will be refunded. 
> 
> Following the reassessment you will be provided with written notice of the outcome as soon as practicable [27a-b].
> 
> Keep in mind that reassessments may identify additional competency deficiencies beyond those found in the initial assessment, in which case gap filling will be required [27a].
> 
> The reassessment decision is final.
>
