### 3. 牙科卫生教育 & 同等学历 DENTAL HYGIENE EDUCATION & SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCY ###

University of Alberta Dental Hygiene Program在阿尔伯塔省有经过认证进行注册的课程，并且是所有的阿尔伯塔省申请人的学习课程的标准。根据规定的第五部分，CRDHA会对学习牙科卫生课程的毕业生的学历和能力进行评估，除了学习阿尔伯塔省可曾的毕业生之外，因为阿尔伯塔大学的课程就是判断学习同等学历课程的毕业生的学历和能力的是否符合认证的课程的水平。

CRDHA必须要接收到官方的成绩单，成绩单上列出了成绩，并确认了牙科卫生的学历/学位，并且成绩单要直接从申请人学习的大专机构的注册处寄送给CRDHA。

申请人必须要提交他们的牙科卫生课程时间表，课程的详细课程大纲，或是课程大纲，大纲要写明教学目标、课时、实验课时、临床实践课时、课程和临床实践能力标准以及评估方法的规定（例如学生是否是由考试、论文、临床评估标准进行评估的），以及师生比例。如果文件不是英文的，则文件里必须要有正式的官方译文。

 

> The University of Alberta Dental Hygiene Program is the approved program for the purpose of registration in Alberta and serves as the benchmark program of study for all Alberta applicants. Under section 5 of the Regulation, CRDHA will assess the qualifications and competencies of graduates of dental hygiene programs other than the University of Alberta program for the purpose of determining substantial equivalence to the qualifications and competencies required for graduation from the approved program.
> 
> 
> CRDHA must receive an official transcript which lists grades and confirms issuance of a diploma/degree in dental hygiene, sent directly to the CRDHA from the Office of the Registrar of the post-secondary institution attended by the applicant.
> 
> 
> Applicants must submit their dental hygiene program timetable and the program’s detailed course outlines or course syllabi listing course objectives, lecture hours, lab hours, clinic hours, course and clinical competency criteria and a description of evaluation methods (e.g. whether students are evaluated by examination, papers, clinical evaluation criteria, etc.), and student to instructor ratios. If the documents are not in English, official translations must accompany the documents.

要协助判断申请人的学历和技能是否真正地和学习阿尔伯塔认证课程的毕业生水平相当,注册人员或注册委员会会要求申请人参加考试、测试或其他的评估,并且会要求申请人参加教育或培训活动,申请人要申请注册就必须要参加这些活动。评估、笔试或临床考试、测试盒其他附加的教育或培训活动的费用都用申请人自己承担。

- 外部的机构评估
- 注册或登记委员会会需要外部的机构来帮助他们评估在境外受训的申请人的学历证书评估。外部机构的评估费用由申请人承担。如果需要外部评估的话,CRDHA会联系你,并向你提供CRDHA选定的评估机构的合同信息。外部评估机构的评估报告必须直接寄给CRDHA。

- 埃尔伯塔临床考试
- 如果是以下的情况,则需要进行临床考试来协助判断申请人的临床实践能力的真实水平:
- 不能仅凭申请人的牙科卫生课程资料的审查报告,就判断其临床实践技能 (知识、技能和判断力)是否和学习埃尔伯塔标准课程的毕业生能力相当。无论如何,在毕业之际,如果申请人的牙科卫生课程没有经过Commission on Dental Accreditation of Canada (CDAC)或American Dental Association Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA)的认证,则申请人就要参加临床考试。

申请人必须在参加临床考试之前完成NDHCB考试。



> In order to assist with determining whether an applicant’s qualifications and competencies are substantially equivalent to those required for graduation from the approved Alberta program, the Registrar or Registration Committee may require the applicant to undergo any examination, testing or other assessment activity, and may direct the applicant to undergo any education or training activities that are considered necessary in order for the applicant to be registered. The cost of assessments, written or clinical examinations, testing, and any additional education or training activities is the responsibility of the applicant.
> 
> - External Agency Assessment
>    - The Registrar or Registration Committee may require the assistance of an external agency to facilitate an academic credential assessm ent for foreign trained applicants. The cost for an assessment conducted by an external agency is the responsibility of the applicant. If this external assessment is required you will be contacted by the CRDHA and will be provided with contact information for assessment agencies acceptable to the CRDHA. A report of an external assessment agency must be sent directly from the agency to the CRDHA.
> - Alberta Clinical Examination
>    - A clinical examination will be required to assist in determining substantial equivalence of clinical competence if: 
>       -  Clinical competence (knowledge, skills abilities and judgment) cannot be determined to be comparable to the competencies required for graduation from the benchmark Alberta program, through a paper review of the applicant’s dental hygiene program documentation. In any event, if, at the time of graduation, the applicant’s dental hygiene program is not accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation of Canada (CDAC) or the American Dental Association Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA) a clinical examination will be required.
> 
> An applicant must successfully complete the NDHCB examination prior to attempting the clinical examination.

在每年的七月或八月初的时候,艾尔伯塔省的埃德蒙顿会举行Alberta Clinical Examination。第二次考试在十一月或十二月举行,为期两天,包括两个部分。要成功通过临床考试,申请人必须成功通过考试的两个部分。

第一部分会评估申请人的知识、技能以及和拍摄。制定、积累和解读口腔射线照片相关的能力。考生必须能对Dexter模型拍摄一套完整的口腔射线系列。此外,考试必须能看懂和解读single film s and panographic films。

第二部分会评估申请人的知识、技能以及和所有的其他的口腔卫生临床手续相关的能力。申请人必须要在第二部分考试中提供一名病人。和病人选择和考试相关的信息在CRDHA临床考试信息指南里可见,这本指南会发给所有的考生。

为期两天的临床考试费用是$18002。在规定的通知期间内,不参加考试的考生要支付 $3003取消考试的费用。没有任何通知的情况下不参加临床考试的考生,要扣除其所有的考试费用。

提醒申请人,临床考试是用英文进行,因此,建议申请人在参加考试之前,要对英语有很好的理解能。

另外,在艾尔伯塔省参加加拿大口腔卫生监管机构举行的临床考试要计算参考次数(最多3次)。成功通过艾尔伯塔省或其他地方的临床考试后,申请人要在艾尔伯塔省临床考试注册第三次或最后一次参试之前,要提供完成治疗或升级课程的证明。

> The Alberta Clinical Examination is held in Edmonton, Alberta in early July or August each year. A second examination may be held in November or December. The clinical examination is a two-day examination consisting of two parts. In order to successfully complete the clinical examination, an applicant must successfully complete both parts of the exam.
> 
> Part 1 assesses an applicant’s knowledge, skills, and competencies related to exposing, developing, mounting and interpreting dental radiographs. Exam candidates must expose a full mouth radiographic series on a Dexter mannequin. Candidates must demonstrate competence in reading and interpreting single film s and panographic films.
> 
> Part 2 assesses an applicant’s knowledge, skills and competencies related to all other dental hygiene clinical procedures. The applicant is required to supply a client for Part 2.

> 
> The fee for the two-day clinical examination is $18002. W ithdrawal from the examination for any reason, within the specified notice period, will result in a cancellation fee of $3003 . W ithdrawal without the minimum notice, or failure to appear for the clinical examination, will result in forfeiture of the entire examination fee.
> 
> Applicants are advised that the clinical examination is conducted in English only, therefore, it is recommended that applicants have a good understanding of the English language prior to attempting the examination.
> 
> 
> Applicants are also advised that unsuccessful attempts at clinical examinations conducted by other Canadian dental hygiene regulatory authorities will be counted toward the number of allowable attempts in Alberta (maximum of 3).

### 11. 完成限制性项目的技能 COMPETENCE TO PRACTICE RESTRICTED ACTIVITIES ###

规定认为限制性项目是牙科卫生员能够参加的。由于这些项目对公众具有一定的的危险性,只有具有特定技能的人才能进行。规定授权的大多数的限制性项目都在认证的牙科卫生教育课程中的基本课程里教授过。(例如,刮牙术,根面平整术,刮除术, 拍射线照片ordering and exposing radiographs)。

CRDHA清楚的知道艾尔伯塔省的牙科卫生员的执业范围包括以下的限制性项目,而和这些限制性项目相关的技能并非包括在所有的牙科卫生教育课程里面。

- 通过注射麻醉病人,为局部麻醉开处方药,并对其进行管理(渗透和阻塞);
- 为清醒的镇静开处方药,并管理一氧化氮/氧;
- 和牙医合作进行恢复手续;
- 和牙医合作进行矫正手续;
- 牙科卫生执业中未步骤一的药品签处方药

不会授权任何人进行限制性项目,除非他们已经成功完成了与以上项目相关的经委员会认证的课程,并且CRDHA会通知申请人他们已经获得授权进行限制性项目。注册申请人不必为首次注册证明在以上的限制性项目中的技能。

> The Regulation identifies “restricted activities” that dental hygienists are authorized to practice. As these activities involve a significant degree of risk to the public, they can only be performed by individuals with specific competencies. Most of the restricted activities authorized in the Regulation are taught in the basic curriculum of accredited dental hygiene educational programs (i.e. scaling, root planing, curettage, ordering and exposing radiographs).
> 
> CRDHA is aware that competencies related to the following restricted activities, which are included in the Alberta dental hygienists’ scope of practice, are not inclusive in all dental hygiene educational programs:
> 
> - Prescribing and administering local anaesthesia by injection (infiltration and block);
> - Prescribing and administering nitrous oxide/oxygen for the purpose of conscious sedation;
> - Restorative procedures of a permanent nature in collaboration with a dentist;
> - Orthodontic procedures including preliminary fitting of appliances in collaboration with a dentist;
> - Preliminary fitting of periodontal appliances in collaboration with a dentist; and
> - Signing prescriptions for the Schedule 1 drugs used in dental hygiene practice
>
