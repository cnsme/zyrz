### 国际申请人 International Applicants ###

对已从非认证的林业课程毕业的毕业生，要申请注册林学家的话，要经过独立的程序对他们的学历进行评估。这些申请人可能是在境外受训，或毕业于未经加拿大林学认证委员会（CFAB）认证的加拿大大学课程。

该程序适用于加拿大境内的每个省份的协会，这些协会属于Canadian Federation of Professional Foresters Associations (CFPFA)，包括对申请人的当前学历、培训以及工作经历的评估，以判断符合认证标准的技能的程度。

请查看详细的认证评估程序手册，该手册列明了需要遵守的要求和申请程序。
(http://www.bablackwell.com/cfpfa/) 

> A separate procedure exists for assessing the credentials of people applying to be registered as a Professional Forester who have graduated from a non-accredited forestry program. These applicants may be foreign-trained, or they may have graduated from a university program in Canada that is not accredited by the Canadian Forestry Accreditation Board (CFAB).
> 
> The procedure is applied consistently across Canada by each provincial association that belongs to the Canadian Federation of Professional Foresters Associations (CFPFA). It involves the assessment of an applicant's current education, training, and experience to determine the extent to which the competencies of the [Certification Standards](http://www.cfpfa-fcafp.ca/English/certificationStandards.html) have been met.
> 
> Please review the detailed [credential assessment process handbook](http://www.bablackwell.com/cfpfa/) that outlines the requirements and the application procedure to follow.

根据该申请程序，申请人需要首先联系他/她希望从事专业的林业工作的省份所在的专门的协会。
一旦启动该程序，申请人的学历将根据国家学历评估程序的规定（具体内容可在申请人手册找到），由独立的评估小组进行评估。该评估小组会向省协会提供一份评估报告，然后由协会对会员申请做出裁决。

由于教育和技能相同的省际标准，林学家和专业林学工程师（来自魁北克）可在相对宽松的条件下，转移到另一个省份。该规定符合《共同认可协议》和《加拿大国内贸易协议》，其中第一个协议是由归属于加拿大林学家协会（CFPFA）的省专业林业工作者协会签署的。

> Under this application process, the applicant first contacts the professional association in the province where he or she wishes to practice professional forestry. Once admitted into the process, assessment of a candidate's credentials is undertaken by an independent panel of assessors in accordance with a national credential assessment process (described in the applicant handbook). The panel provides an assessment report to the provincial association, which then makes a decision about the membership application.
> 
> Professional Foresters and Professional Forest Engineers (from Quebec) may transfer to another province with relative ease because of common interprovincial standards for education and competencies. This is in line with a Mutual Recognition Agreement signed by the provincial professional foresters associations that belong to the Canadian Federation of Professional Foresters Associations (CFPFA) and Canada's Agreement on Internal Trade.

### 限制性会员 Restricted Membership ###

限制性会员可能不能完全满足成为注册领学家或注册专业林学技师的教育和工作要求，且可能为成功通过ASFP注册考试。他们可能在特定的林业方面或综合科学方面有特长。根据限制性会员的从业范围和时长的情况，他们可获得授权从事林业工作。他们也有权利使用“限制性会员”的称号并在专业文件上签字和盖章。

> Restricted members may not fully meet the educational and employment requirements needed to become a Registered Professional Forester or Registered Professional Forest Technologist and may not have successfully completed the ASFP registration exam. They may have expertise in specific aspects of forestry or an allied science. Restricted members are entitled to practice forestry in accordance with conditions set on the scope of their practice and length of time they may practice. They also have the right to use the title "Restricted member" and to sign and seal professional documents.

根据注册林学家或注册专业林学技师的规定，培训会员不能从事该行业，且他们的工作要求他们必须从事专业林业工作，培训会员可在担任培训会员的同时，也能申请限制性会员身份。这是一项过渡机制，当ASFP转换为在从业机构工作的权利，该机制就可以启动。

>  A member-in-training who is unable to practice under the supervision of a Registered Professional Forester or Registered Professional Forest Technologist, and whose job requires them to engage in the professional practice of forestry, may apply for restricted membership status while serving as a member-in-training. This is a transition mechanism, available for use while the ASFP switches to operating as a Right to Practice organization.
> 
> [Restricted Membership Category for Members in Training Transitioning to Right to Practice](http://asfp.ca/images/Regulating_the_Profession/RTP_Transition_Mechansims_Draft_Watermark_140318.pdf)

申请人应该完成以下申请表并向ASFP寄送所有的文件，通讯地址为102C 1061 Central Avenue, Prince Albert, SK, S6V 4V4。您的申请材料包括申请表，申请费用，高等教育机构的成绩单，当前的简历，以及申请限制性会员身份的解释信，并列明您从业的范围和时长。一旦我们接收了完整的材料，录取委员会就会开始审查您的申请。

> Applicants should complete the application form below and send all documents to the ASFP at 102C 1061 Central Avenue, Prince Albert, SK, S6V 4V4. Your completed application package consists of the application form, application fee, transcripts from all post-secondary institutions, a current resume, and a letter that explains why you are requesting restricted membership status and outlines your desired scope and length of practice. Once we receive this complete package, the Admissions Committee will review your application.

**2.0 目的 Purpose**

培训会员政策的目的和预期结果是：

- 根据 active RPFs/RPFTs的直接规定，通过确保培训会员仅从事专业林业行业的工作，以维护专业林业行业的公共利益。
- 提供指导课程，在该行业的技能、独立、正值和责任方面为新会员提供指导（例如他们的发展的专业方向）。
- 督促主办者负责为培训会员的发展提供建议和指导。
- 帮助培训会员准备他们的注册考试和注册会员的独立专业实践。



The purposes and intended outcomes of this Member in Training Policy are to:

- Uphold the public interest in the practice of professional forestry by ensuring members in training only engage in professional forestry under direct supervision of active RPFs/RPFTs.
- Provide a mentoring program that counsels new members in competence,independence, integrity and accountability of practice (e.g. their development towards professionalism).
- Hold sponsors accountable for providing advice and direction for the development of members in training.
- Help members in training prepare for their registration exam and independent professional practice as registered members.

**3.0 范围 Scope**

该项政策适用于所有的培训会员以及培训会员的所有的主办者。

培训会员类有两个分类： 培训林业工作者（FITs）和培训林业技师（FTITs）

新的会员必须要花2年时间学习培训---完成学历要求。如果有学历的话，就提高技能，如果是规定的话，根据注册ASFP会员的指南，要获得相关的工作和职业经历。在两年培训期结束的时候，会员要参加注册考试，如果考试通过的话，就可以成为真正的可以执业并注册的会员。


> This policy applies to all members in training as well as any sponsor of each member in training.
> 
> The member in training class has two categories: Foresters in Training (FITs) and Forest Technologists in Training (FTITs)
> 
> A new member must spend 2 years in training -- completing academic requirements, if any, improving competencies, if required, and gaining relevant work and professional experience under the guidance of a registered ASFP member. At the end of the two year period the member writes a registration examination and if successful, becomes a fully practicing, registered member.

**4.0 背景 Background**

林业资源对当地人，全国人民乃至世界人民都非常重要。立法、政策以及各种标准都制定了旨在保护社会森林价值的要求。然而，这些要求不能全面覆盖可能在林业实践中出现的每个管理性和技术性的突发事情。公共需要判断林学家的管理和保护森林资源的专业技能，教育和培训以及他们对社会所做的贡献。ASFP是监管机构，能授权萨克彻温省的林业从业资格。该协会致力于确保从业者符合独立从业的资格，公正从业（根据道德准侧的规定），以及对从业行为负责。

学习培训课程的ASFP会员是积极的当前ASFP会员和新发展的会员之间重要的纽带，旨在为培训会员提供指导老师和专业的指导。

在培训期间，在培训会员参加赞助者的注册考试和最终评估时，为他们提供探索职业要素的机会。

ASFP道德准则号召所有的会员提供建议，认可，支持，指导，知识和经验。

为了注册为培训林业工作者或培训林业技师，应试者必须找到合适的活跃的或刚退休的1RPF或RPFT ASFP会员去担当他们的保证人。


> Forest resources are important to people locally, nationally and internationally. Requirements aimed at protecting societal forest values are set out in legislation, policy and standards. However, these requirements cannot cover every administrative and technical issue that may arise in the practice of forestry. The public relies on the judgment and discretion of forestry professionals who have acquired specialized skills, education and training to manage and conserve forest resources and the values they contribute to society. The ASFP is a regulatory body to which the practice of forestry in Saskatchewan has been entrusted. The association works to ensure practitioners are competent and independent, act with integrity (as defined by the Code of Ethics) and are held accountable for their conduct.
> 
> The ASFP member in training program is an important link between actively practicing, existing ASFP members and new developing members. It is intended to provide members in training with mentoring and professional guidance.
> 
> The in training period provides the member in training with the opportunity to explore various elements of the profession prior to the registration exam and final evaluation by the sponsor.
> 
> The ASFP Code of Ethics calls on all members to provide advice, recognition, support,guidance, knowledge and experience with others.
> 
> To enroll as a Forester in Training or Forest Technologist in Training candidates must find two suitable active or a recently retired1 RPF or RPFT ASFP members to act as their sponsors.

**5.0 Rights**

培训会员的权利在ASFP规章的第十部分有如下规定：

- 有使用FIT或FTIT称号的权利。
- 能申请离职和复职。
- 有出席协会会议的资格，并在会议中讲话。
- 向协会陈述关于专业技能和行为的事情，以及专业的林业从业行为。
- 可在临时委员会工作。

> - Have the right to use the title FIT or FTIT, as the case may be
> - Can apply for leaves of absence and reinstatement
> - Are entitled to attend meetings of the association, and make representations at them
> - Can make representations to the council on issues regarding professional competency and conduct, and the professional practice of forestry; and 
> - Can serve on ad hoc committees.

**6.0 义务 Obligations**

培训的保证人和会员关系是建立在信任基础之上一种义务关系。任何一方都承担着共同的责任，就是确保培训会员要根据活跃的RPFs或RPFTs的规定从业，或限制性会员要符合规章制度。

> Sponsor and member in training relationships are one of mutual obligation built on trust. Each
> party shares a joint obligation to ensure that the member in training only practices under the
> supervision of active RPFs, RPFTs or restricted members consistent with the Bylaws.

> Sponsors have accountability for overseeing the development of members in training. To this end, when sponsors sign the Member in Training Agreement they are making a commitment to:
> 
> follow the requirements of this Member in Training Policy;
> mentor and guide members in training through the in training period and the registration examination process;

**7.0 要符合的条件 Conditions to be Met**

保证人必须是活跃的RPF，RPFTs或是刚退休的信誉良好的RPFTs，且至少在ASFP有两年的经历。

如果需要的话，录取委员会可以帮助培训会员寻找保证人。保证人和培训会员的关系应该是：

- 通过保证人介绍，培训会员在认证机构有工作岗位；
- 培训会员和保证人之间有联系；
- 保证人不能向培训会员提供充分的时间和指导。

在一定的基础上，培训会员应该寻找保证人，并同其共同工作，且要有直接联系。尽管培训员和保证人一起不必工作，但是使双方的关系更具挑战性。


> Sponsors must be active RPF, RPFTs or recently retired RPF and RPFTs in good standing of
> the ASFP for a minimum of 2 years.
> 
> The Admissions Committee may assist the member in training in finding sponsors if required.
> Sponsor and member in training relationships should not exist if:
> 
> the member in training is in an employment position of authority over a sponsor; or
> the member in training and a sponsor are related; or,
> a sponsor is unable to provide adequate time and direction to the member in training.
> 
> Members in training should look for sponsors with whom they work or are in direct contact with
> on a regular basis. While it is possible to have sponsors with whom the member in training does
> not work, it makes the relationship more challenging.

**8.0 为培训会员更改保证人 Changing Sponsors for the Member in Training**

如果双方的责任不能达到他们的期望值，可以要求更换保证人。更改保证人的情况有很多种，共同的理由有：

- 培训会员或保证人搬离某地；
- 培训会员或保证人变更工作；
- 培训会员需要不同的意见；
- 培训会员和保证人不能和谐相处。



> If the situation is such that the parties cannot live up to the obligations expected of them in this
> policy, a change of sponsor may be required. There are a wide range of circumstances in which
> it may become necessary or desirable for a change in sponsor. Common reasons are:
> 
> - the member in training or sponsor moves from the area;
> - the member in training or sponsor has a change in employment;
> - the member in training requires a different perspective; or,
> - member in training and sponsor incompatibility


**8.1 由培训会员引起的变更事项 Changes by the Member in Training**

在任何情况下，如果培训会员认为她/他不能从保证人那里获得足够的指导，她/他就可以直接向保证人提出问题，并提出质疑，告知其接下来的变更事项，并讨论变更的原因。参与者不必感到能继续进行指导的压力。

之后，培训会员需要寻找另一位保证人，可以寻找其他的注册会员，且他们已经担任过非正式的指导员。

培训会员可以邀请除了他们的保证人之外的其他的ASFP成员担任指导老师。

> In any situation where a member-in-training feels that they may not be getting sufficient guidance from a sponsor, they will address the matter directly with the sponsor in question by informing him or her of the intended change and discussing the reasons why. Neither participant should feel pressure to continue a mentorship that is not working. 
> 
> The member in training then needs to seek out another sponsor, and can look towards other registered members who may have been serving as mentors in a more informal way. 
> 
> Members in training may rely on other ASFP members as mentors in addition to their
> sponsors.

**8.2 由保证人引起的变更 Changes by a Sponsor**

保证人如果认为必要的话，也可以变更他们对培训会员的责任。保证人会联系培训会员讨论接下来的变更事项，并帮助培训会员找到新的保证人。

> Sponsors may also find it necessary to change their commitment to the member in training. The sponsor will contact the member in training, discuss the intended change and assist the member in training in finding a new sponsor.

**8.3  通知ASFP Notifying the ASFP**

培训会员要通过提交一份新的Member in Training Agreement，通知ASFP的注册办事处关于保证人/培训会员变更的事项。


> The member in training will notify the ASFP’s registration office of any changes to a sponsor/member-in-training relationship by submitting a new Member in Training Agreement.

**9.0 职业发展计划和执业日志 Professional Development Plan and Practice Diary**

所有的培训会员必须要持有职业发展计划Professional Development Plan（附录3）和培训会员执业日志Member in Training Practice Diary（附录4）。

职业发展计划必须要制定一份如附录2所述的充分的执业机会的计划。要和保证人一起制定计划，并要不断地对计划进行修改。充分的执业机会需要多种资源，包括：工作经验，教育培训，考试之前的自主指导学习等。

执业日志提供了一份在培训期间进行职业发展的书面记录。日志应该清晰的描述培训会员是如何实现职业发展计划的。

ASFP可以要求培训会员提交职业发展计划和执业日志，来验证培训会员是否达到了ASFP的培训要求。

培训会员应该定期和保证人见面，讨论会员的职业发展。这些讨论可以包括职业发展计划的进程，获得执业机会的途径，回答培训会员可能遇到的任何的问题等。

> A Professional Development Plan (Appendix 3) and a Member in Training Practice Diary (Appendix 4) must be kept by all members in training.
> 
> A Professional Development Plan must identify a strategy for gaining adequate exposure to the practice as described in Appendix 2. Plans may need to be modified from time to time and should be done in conjunction with the sponsors. Adequate exposure may come through a variety of sources including: work experience, educational training, self-directed study prior to the exam, etc.
> 
> The Practice Diary provides a written record of the professional development undertaken during the in training period. The Diary should clearly articulate how the member in training is meeting the Professional Development Plan. 
> 
> The ASFP may require that the member in training submit the Plan and Diary to verify that the in training requirements of the ASFP have been met.
> 
> The member in training should meet regularly with his or her sponsors to discuss professional development. These discussions may involve progress on the Professional Development Plan, alternative means of gaining exposure, answer any questions the member in training might have, etc.

**10.0 注册考试 Registration Exam**

在为期两年的培训期结束时，要参加注册考试（也称为法律考试）。考试内容包括ASFP会员必须要掌握的道德准则，在萨克彻温省从事林业工作的成员需要了解联邦和省级立法，附录5列明了萨克彻温省的培训会员期望了解的关于注册考试的知识，这些知识涉及多个领域。


在考试日期很久以前，注册考试就决定了成败。要获得必要的知识，以及提高培训会员在考试过程中能够放松和有效交流的自信，准备阶段非常重要。尽管自从保证人参加完考试之后已经很多年过去了，但是保证人可以帮助培训会员获得必要的资源，准备考试，以及向他们推荐小组学习的方法以备战考试。


> The registration exam (also known as a jurisprudence exam) is written towards the end of the 2-year in training period. The exam will include information such as the code of ethics which ASFP members are required to know, and the federal and provincial legislation members practicing forestry in Saskatchewan need to understand. Appendix 5 lists a variety of areas of knowledge as related to Saskatchewan that members in training may be expected to know on the registration exam.
> 
> Registration exam success begins long before the examination date. Preparation is important to gain the necessary knowledge as well as to develop a level of confidence to allow the member in training to relax and effectively communicate during the examination process. While it may have been many years since sponsors have been involved in the exam, sponsors can assist members in training in acquiring the necessary resources, preparing for the exam, and by introducing them to a study group in preparation for the exam.

期待加入Association of Saskatchewan Forestry Professionals (ASFP)的应试者必须完成ASFP的注册考试。协会已经把设置考试的任务分派给了录取协会Admissions Committee，要确保考试的申请、管理、评估等全面、公平。该政策的目的就是要设置注册考试的申请、管理和评估程序。

> Candidates seeking to join the Association of Saskatchewan Forestry Professionals (ASFP) must complete the ASFP Registration Exam. Council has delegated the task of setting the registration exam to the Admissions Committee with instructions to ensure that the exam is comprehensive and fair in its application, administration, and evaluation. The purpose of this policy is to set out the process for application, administration, and evaluation of the registration exam.

**5.0 请求参加考试 Request to Write the Exam**

所有参加考试的申请必须在申请人计划参加考试的提前一个月进行申请。不提供充足的通知的后果就是错过政策规定的参加考试的截止日期。注册员会通知应试者考试时间。应试者应该联系注册员询问考试的具体要求。

> All requests to write the exam must be made at least one month in advance of the date in which the candidate would like to write. The consequences of not providing sufficient notice is missing deadlines to write as described in this policy. The Registrar will notify candidates of the exam date. Candidates should contact the Registrar for specific instructions for the exam.

**6.0 特殊的考试要求 Special Exam Requests**

出于某种原因，如果应试者需要考试做特殊的调整，例如把书面考试变成口语考试，则应试者必须向ASFP Registrar提前3个月提交一份书面申请。

请告知ASFP申请调整考试的原因，包括出具保证人/指导员的证明信。Admissions Committee 会和应试者一起做出适当的安排。申请注册考试特殊调整需要逐个审查，并由Admissions Committee单独裁定。

> If for any reason a candidate would like a special accommodation to be made for the exam, such as being given an oral exam instead of the written version, the candidate must submit a written request to the ASFP Registrar 3 months ahead of the time he or she wishes to write.
>  
> Please inform the ASFP of the reason for such a request and include any supporting information such as letters from sponsors/mentors. The Admissions Committee will work with candidates to make alternative arrangements as appropriate. Requests for special accommodations for the registration exams are reviewed on a case-by-case basis and decisions are made at the sole discretion of the Admissions Committee.

**7.0 参加考试 Writing the Exam**

所有的培训会员，限制性会员和转移的林学家必须要通过注册考试。补考机会和程序如下。

The exam will be sent to candidates first thing in the morning and must be returned by email to the Registrar within 8 hours. Any issue in receiving the exam should be immediately reported to the Registrar.

**8.0 考试形式和评分 Exam Format and Marking**

考试形式可能会因时而异，但是Admissions Committee会提前通知应试者考试的形式。当前，考试的形式是可在家完成的开卷考试形式。开卷考试意味着应试者可以使用电脑，书面资料，个人笔记等。尽管考试是开卷，但是考试时不可和他人商议。

考试规定及格分为总分的75%。

Admissions Committee或该协会的会员是由大多数人推选出来的，他们为所有的考试评分。评分程序要确保所有考试的评分标准保持一致。一旦试卷完成评分后，评分结果（如果需要的话）将由Admissions Committee审查。完成审查之后，评分结果就最后确定了，且不可上诉。

> The format of the exam may differ from time to time but the Admissions Committee will advise candidates of the format well in advance of the exam date. Currently the exam format is a take home open book format. Open book means that candidates are allowed the use of a computer, written material, or personal notes. Although the exam is open book, no consultation with any other person is permitted.
> 
> An overall passing grade of 75% is required on the exam. 
> 
> The Admissions Committee, or members of the Committee assigned by majority vote of the Committee, will mark and remark (if required) all exams. Marking procedures are designed to ensure consistency in the marking of all exams. Once the exam has been marked and remarked, (if required) the results will be reviewed by the Admissions Committee. Upon completion of this review, the results are final and no appeal is possible. 


**9.0 公布考试分数 Releasing Exam Marks**

Admissions Committee的主席会向协会报告考试结果。如果协会审查了考试结果后，他们就会和Registrar进行沟通。协会会给成功通过考试的申请人一个注册号，并让其成为注册员。

考试的评分副本将由ASFP保存。 应试者可以通过Registrar向Admissions Committee请求审查评分结果。未通过考试的应试者可以要求一两名Admissions Committee的会员和他们或他们的保证人一起审查他们的试卷，找到哪里需要进一步的学习。如果需要反馈，则

- 和应试者个人没有关系的Admissions Committee的主席和会员需要向应试者提供反馈。
- 反馈内容关于一般的问题领域，需要进一步学习的培训领域，以及对应试者所缺失信息的指导
- 评分考试问题不再公布
- A进行试卷审查的dmissions Committee的会员应该对考试保密，但是给他们提供的副本需要立即删除和销毁。


> The chair of the Admissions Committee will report the exam results to Council. Once Council has reviewed the exam results, they will be communicated by the Registrar. Successful applicants are then assigned a registration number and added to the register.
> 
> The marked copy of the exam will be kept by the ASFP. Candidates can request a review of their results from the Admissions Committee via the Registrar. Candidates failing the exam can request that one or more members of the Admissions Committee review the exam with them, or them and their sponsors, to see where further study may be required. When feedback is requested:
> 
> - The Chair and / or a member of the Admissions Committee that has no connection with the individual will provide the candidate with feedback.
> - Feedback will be around general areas where problems were, coaching on areas more study is needed in, and guidance on where the candidate can find the information they were missing.
> - The marked exam questions will not be shared.
> - The Admissions Committee members doing the review should be privy to the exam, but any copies they are given will be deleted and shredded immediately.
