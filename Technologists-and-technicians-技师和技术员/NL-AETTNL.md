### 专业技师 - 飞出国 ###

工程技术专业认证课程的毕业生，在毕业后拥有了两年合格的工作经验后，可申请工程技师注册。

工程的课程包括以应用科学和应用数学的核心为基础的一般课题，例如微积分、微分方程简介、统计学、线性代数和计算机科学，允许毕业生将数学作为技术分析和设计的工具。

课程包科学和工程基础理论，这些理论也适用于数学核心领域的特定的部门或专业的工程技术。技术课程的学术理论部分都将通过适当的实验室实验和练习，大约占学术课程的三分之一。

工程技师的职业功能有很大的不同。利用专业知识，他们可以从应届毕业生的简单任务发展为与专业工程师和工程管理人员相媲美的责任的技术责任，其中评估测试是和负责人的决定是必须的。

专业的决策是必要的，工程技师也会发现他们与专业工程师是有联系的，除非法律有其它规定。

在行政岗位上，工程技师可以从事管理和行政职责。

工程技师可以从事区域范围内大方向的复杂工作，如工程、设计生产、销售，维修，质量控制、质量认证和施工活动的检查和监督。他们可能作为一个不同技术出售领域的技术销售代表。

工程技师评估他们的任务、确定目标、定义问题和确定流程来做出有效的解决方案或主动地解读工程师的创意（他们往往是工厂里的技术权威，尤其是小型工厂）工程技师的时间表是为了达成目标并参加短程和长程规划。

他们可以监督和协调工程技师、工程技术员和熟练技工的活动，也可能被分配工程专家和科学家的行政工作。他们可能为缺乏经验的技术人员和专业人员进行培训。

在纽芬兰及拉布拉多省，学术专业技师（PTech），认证的工程技师（CET）和应用科学技师（ASCT）都是等同的。但是，目前我们只认可PTech.

> ## Professional Technologist (PTech) ##

> A graduate of an accredited curriculum in engineering technology (or equivalent) who has completed two years of satisfactory practical experience in employment following graduation may be certified as an engineering technologist. 

> The curriculum followed by the engineering technologist shall have been based upon a core of applied science and applied mathematics generally including topics such as differential and integral calculus, and introduction to differential equations, statistics, linear algebra and computer science which will permit the graduate to use mathematics as a tool in the synthesis of designs or in the analysis of technical problems.

> The curriculum will also have included the fundamentals of science and engineering applicable to a particular branch or specialty of engineering technology, taught in term of the mathematics core. The academic and theoretical portions of the technical curriculum will have been reinforced by suitable laboratory experiments and exercises amounting to approximately one-third of the total academic curriculum.

> The occupational functions of the engineering technologist vary widely. In a technical capacity they may progress from the relatively simple tasks of the recent graduate to complex technical responsibilities which are comparable to those of professional engineers and engineering supervisors, where the exercise of judgment is required and responsible decisions are essential.

> Where professional decisions are required, the engineering technologist will always find that they will be associated with professional engineers except where otherwise provided by law.

> In an administrative capacity, the engineering technologist may gravitate away from purely technical responsibilities assuming instead the responsibilities of administration and management up to the highest levels.

> The engineering technologist may carry out a wide range of complex work processes under general direction in areas such as engineering, design production, marketing, maintenance, quality control, quantity surveying, inspection and supervision of construction activities. They may be employed as a technical sales representative and in all of the levels of responsibility related to technical sales.

> The engineering technologist evaluates their assignments, determines the objectives, defines the problems and determines the procedures to effect solutions to the problems, either to interpret the creative ideas of engineers or on his own initiative (they will often be the only technical authority in a plant, especially in smaller plants). The engineering technologist schedules work to meet the objectives and participates in long and short range planning.

> They may supervise and coordinate the activities of engineering technologist, engineering technicians and skilled craftsmen and they may be assigned administrative responsibility for engineering specialists and scientists. They may often assist in the training of less experienced technical staff including professionals.
> In Newfoundland and Labrador, the terms Professional Technologist (PTech), Certified Engineering Technologist (CET) and Applied Science Technologist (AScT) are all equivalent.  However, we only currently award the designation PTech.

### 专业技师 ###

工程技术认证课程的毕业生，同时在毕业后拥有了两年的令人满意的就业实践经验，可注册工程技师资格。

工程的课程应以应用科学和应用数学的核心为基础的一般话题，例如微积分、微分方程简介、统计学、线性代数和计算机科学，允许毕业生将数学作为技术分析和设计的工具。

课程包科学和工程基础理论，这些理论也适用于数学核心领域的特定的部门或专业的工程技术。技术课程的学术理论部分都将通过适当的实验室实验和练习，大约占学术课程的三分之一。

工程技师的职业功能有很大的不同。利用专业知识，他们可以从应届毕业生的简单任务发展为与专业工程师和工程管理人员相媲美的责任的技术责任，其中评估测试是和负责人的决定是必须的。

专业的决策是必要的，工程技师也会发现他们与专业工程师是有联系的，除非法律有其它规定。

在行政岗位上，工程技师可以从纯技术职责，而不是高水平的管理和行政职责。

工程技师可以从事区域范围内大方向的复杂工作，如工程、设计生产、销售，维修，质量控制、质量认证和施工活动的检查和监督。他们可能作为一个不同技术出售领域的技术销售代表。

工程技师评估他们的任务、确定目标、定义问题和确定流程来做出有效的解决方案或主动地解读工程师的创意（他们往往是工厂里的技术权威，尤其是小型工厂）工程技师的时间表是为了达成目标并参加短程和长程规划。

他们可以监督和协调工程技师、工程技术员和熟练技工的活动，也可能被分配工程专家和科学家的行政工作。他们可能为缺乏经验的技术人员和专业人员进行培训。

在纽芬兰及拉布拉多省，学术专业技师（PTech），认证的工程技师（CET）和应用科学技师（ASCT）都是等同的。但是，目前我们只认可PTech.

> ## Professional Technologist (PTech) ##

> A graduate of an accredited curriculum in engineering technology (or equivalent) who has completed two years of satisfactory practical experience in employment following graduation may be certified as an engineering technologist. 

> The curriculum followed by the engineering technologist shall have been based upon a core of applied science and applied mathematics generally including topics such as differential and integral calculus, and introduction to differential equations, statistics, linear algebra and computer science which will permit the graduate to use mathematics as a tool in the synthesis of designs or in the analysis of technical problems.

> The curriculum will also have included the fundamentals of science and engineering applicable to a particular branch or specialty of engineering technology, taught in term of the mathematics core. The academic and theoretical portions of the technical curriculum will have been reinforced by suitable laboratory experiments and exercises amounting to approximately one-third of the total academic curriculum.

> The occupational functions of the engineering technologist vary widely. In a technical capacity they may progress from the relatively simple tasks of the recent graduate to complex technical responsibilities which are comparable to those of professional engineers and engineering supervisors, where the exercise of judgment is required and responsible decisions are essential.

> Where professional decisions are required, the engineering technologist will always find that they will be associated with professional engineers except where otherwise provided by law.

> In an administrative capacity, the engineering technologist may gravitate away from purely technical responsibilities assuming instead the responsibilities of administration and management up to the highest levels.

> The engineering technologist may carry out a wide range of complex work processes under general direction in areas such as engineering, design production, marketing, maintenance, quality control, quantity surveying, inspection and supervision of construction activities. They may be employed as a technical sales representative and in all of the levels of responsibility related to technical sales.

> The engineering technologist evaluates their assignments, determines the objectives, defines the problems and determines the procedures to effect solutions to the problems, either to interpret the creative ideas of engineers or on his own initiative (they will often be the only technical authority in a plant, especially in smaller plants). The engineering technologist schedules work to meet the objectives and participates in long and short range planning.

> They may supervise and coordinate the activities of engineering technologist, engineering technicians and skilled craftsmen and they may be assigned administrative responsibility for engineering specialists and scientists. They may often assist in the training of less experienced technical staff including professionals.
> In Newfoundland and Labrador, the terms Professional Technologist (PTech), Certified Engineering Technologist (CET) and Applied Science Technologist (AScT) are all equivalent.  However, we only currently award the designation PTech.

### 认证技术人员 ###

认可课程的应用科学/工程技术员（或同等学历），已经有两年令人满意的工作经验，毕业后可以注册成为技术员。

科学/工程技术员的课程将以应用科学为基础，包括物理和化学的原理、技术和应用数学的核心，包括代数学、几何学、三角法和微积分，来一定程度上对所需的课程技术部分做出解释。该课程也将有包括适用于工程技术的一个狭窄专业的科学和工程学的基本原理。数学的核心、调用的经验，而不是技术的分解分析中学到这些理论。

技术课程的学术理论部分都将通过适当的实验室实验和练习来学习，技术课程不超过总数的百分之五十。

学/工程技术人员的职业能力通常会与相对狭窄的专业技术领域相关。他们可以从刚毕业相对的简单任务到成公认技术专家的任务的进展。

科学/工程技术人员通常会收到技术主管的指导，尤其是科学/工程技师或工程师。

科学/工程技术人员可能携带各种涉及专业技术化领域的操作的非常规并相当复杂的工作流程。

可协助设备，系统或流程的设计，包括规格技术图纸的解释、编制和修改。

可以构造模型和原型或操作试点工厂测试的生产方法、工艺和设备。

可能因复杂的设备、生产、试验或施工难题而采取纠正措施，并提出建议和准备报告。

可以为工厂的时间、数量、材料和劳动力需求，例如测试、安装、、施工和可能花费的时间和工时标准和工作制定标准做预测准备。


在不持续时间或连续的基础上，承担一些熟练技工的职责。科学/工程技术人员检查他们的任务、目标、指示、选择标准、非标准的程序，技术和设备以产生分配问题的解决方案。

> ### Certified Technician (CTech) ###

> A graduate of an accredited curriculum for applied science/engineering technicians (or equivalent) who has completed two years of satisfactory practical experience in employment following graduation may be registered as an Technician.

> The curriculum followed by the science/engineering Technician will have been based upon a core of applied science including the principles of physics and chemistry and a core of technical and applied mathematics including algebra, geometry and trigonometry and differential and integral calculus to the extent that is required for the explanation of technical components of the curriculum. The curriculum will also have included the fundamentals of science and engineering applicable to a narrow specialty of engineering technology, taught in terms of the mathematics core, and probably invoking empirical rather than analytical solutions to technical problems.

> The academic and theoretical portions of the technical curriculum will have been reinforced by suitable laboratory experiments and exercises amounting to not more than fifty percent of the total technical curriculum.

> The occupational functions of an science/engineering technician will normally be related to a relatively narrow area of technical specialization. They may progress from the relatively simple tasks of the recent graduate to those of an acknowledged technical specialist.

> The science/engineering technician will normally receive direction from a technical supervisor, usually an science/engineering technologist or an engineer.

> The science/engineering technician may carry a variety of non-routine fairly complex work processes involving a substantial number of operations in an area of technical specialization.

 

> May assist design of equipment, systems or processes, including the interpretation of specifications and the preparation or modification of technical drawing
> 
> May construct models and prototypes or operate pilot plants to test production methods, processes or equipment.
> 
>　May trouble shoot complex equipment, production, test or construction problems, initiate corrective action and make recommendations and prepare reports.
>　
> May prepare estimates of time, quantities, material and labor requirements for such activities as manufacturing, testing, installation and construction and may be involved in conducting time and motion studies and in developing work standards.
> 
>　May perform some of the duties of skilled tradesmen but not for sustained periods or on a continuing basis.
The science/engineering technician examines their assignments, objectives and instructions; selects standard and non-standard procedures, techniques and equipment to effect solution of the assigned problem.
