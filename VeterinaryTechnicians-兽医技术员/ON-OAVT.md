> The Veterinary Technician National Examination (VTNE) is owned and administered by the American Association of Veterinary State Boards (AAVSB). The VTNE is used to evaluate entry-level veterinary technicians' competency to practice and to be credentialed. The computer-based exam is given in three testing windows per year (winter, summer, fall) and is constantly updated, reviewed and re-evaluated by highly-qualified item writers so that it remains a valid tool.


> Most states and provinces require a passing score on the VTNE as one criterion for receiving credentials. The exam is administered at Prometric Testing Centers throughout the U.S. and Canada.


> **Testing Window of VTNE -	Deadline for Registration**


> - March 15 to April 15 
- February 15
- July 15 to August 15 
- June 15

> *Currently, there are four locations available in Ontario: Hamilton, London, Ottawa and Toronto


> **To qualify for the VTNE you must be:**

- a Pending member of the OAVT in good standing

> **How to Register to Write the VTNE**

> **First Steps**

> - Candidates log onto https://www.aavsb.org/Application/?service=23 to register and pay for the exam directly with AAVSB
- If you aren't already, become a Pending Member of the OAVT. (Become a member.)
- Candidates with special accommodations, please contact the OAVT office.
- Once you have completed both of these steps we will confirm with your college your eligibility (you are a graduate of an approved program) and then authorize you to write the exam.
- An Authorization-to-Test (ATT) letter from the Professional Examination Service (PES) will be emailed to you with instructions explaining how to make an appointment for the examination (arrange your location and time)

> **After the Exam**

> - As soon as the exam is completed, you will receive a provisional, unofficial on-screen Pass/Fail score which cannot be printed.
- You will receive your official exam score usually about 3-4 weeks after the session is completed. These are available to the candidates electronically. These reports are thus printable.
- The province/state indicated as the candidate's jurisdiction (that is the provincial or state association) will also receive an official report at about the same time.
- OAVT compiles the results and provides a summary report to all the colleges.


> **Preparing for the VTNE**

> There are many resources on the market for individuals interested in preparing to write the Veterinary Technician National Examination.
