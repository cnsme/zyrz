### 概述 General ### FLYabroad

所有申请必须机打或清晰地书写，以便该协会工程资格委员会审核后向协会提出后续建议。附上必须的费用（注册费和会员年费），以汇票或支票的形式交给爱德华王子岛省工程师协会。

请仔细阅读申请表，并将信息填写完整。需详细填写第3页第4项，便于评估你的工作经历。内容包含工作职位，简明概述工作职责和完成的工程项目，并写上你主管的名字，主管叙事专业工程师。

只有经注册专业工程师证实的工作经验才会被认可，且该工程师需是你的直接上级。

在读工程硕士期间的工作经验将被等同为一年全职工程经验，否则工作经验将全被认可。

## 全国专业执业考试（NPPE）NATIONAL PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE EXAM ##

**考试日期 Examination Dates:** FLYabroad

每年的4月和10月

> April and October of each year

**Charlottetown, PE** FLYabroad

亚伯达专业工程师和地球科学家协会（APEGA）代表加拿大工程师协会管理全国专业执业考试（NPPE）

想注册成为专业工程师，作为爱德华王子岛省工程师协会会员（如专业工程师），申请人必须通过全国专业执业考试；如果已经通过了加拿大其他省份或领地管辖区的认可的同等考试，可以不参加此项考试。

全国专业执业考试目的在于检测申请人是否对专业工程师的伦理道德和义务，所持有的特权及法律概念有所了解。一部分考察申请人的专业知识水平，另一部分考察申请人对工程法，司法条款，工程专业法案及规章制度的熟悉程度。

> The National Professional Practice Examination (NPPE) is administered by the Engineering Examinations Office of the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta (APEGA) on behalf of Engineers Canada.
> 
> All applicants for professional registration as a Member of Engineers PEI (i.e. P.Eng.) are required to pass the National Professional Practice Examination, unless that examination or an acceptable equivalent has been written successfully in another Canadian provincial or territorial jurisdiction.
> 
> The NPPE is designed to examine applicants on the ethical considerations and obligations that accompany the privileges of professional status and the legal concepts relevant to professional engineers. Part of the examination tests the applicant's understanding of professionalism, while the remaining part tests the applicant's knowledge of engineering law and familiarity with jurisdiction-specific statutes, rules and regulations and the Engineering Profession Act and By-Laws.

### 考试资格/豁免权Eligibility/Exceptions ### FLYabroad

完成正规教育后有至少1年的工作经验有利于申请人参加考试。为了符合参加全国专业执业考试条件，必须积极的提交申请成为专业会员或积极注册成为实习工程师。已通过了其他省份的全国专业执业工程师考试或在加拿大其他协会注册过，将会获得豁免权。但仍需要书面证明申请人已阅读、理解并同意遵守爱德华王子岛省工程师各项法案、规章制度和职业道德。

> It is considered beneficial for applicants to have at least one year of work experience after completion of their formal education before the examination is attempted. To be eligible to write the NPPE, you must also have an active application for Professional Membership or be enrolled as an Engineer-in-Training. An exemption will be granted to applicants who have passed the NPPE in another province or who are registered with another Canadian Association. Such applicants are still required to confirm in writing that they have read, understood, and agree to follow the Act and By-Laws and Code of Ethics of Engineers PEI.
