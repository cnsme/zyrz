## 关于MCC - 飞出国 ##

加拿大医务委员会（MCC)致力于对医生进行严格审查为加拿大公民提供最高水平的医疗护理，每年通过其审查的医学生和医学毕业生超过11000人，其考试（MCCEE)不仅在加拿大所有考点都有两种官方语言形式，且在全世界80多个国家中共设有500多个考点。加拿大医务委员会（MCC)是认证和颁发医学证书最多的机构，其证书也同样受加拿大其他医学组织的认可。  


作为加拿大医学登记机构，MCC负责登记符合其要求的医学毕业生。而且，MCC还致力于医学研究和发展，以保证自己始终走在医学评估创新的前沿。

## 考试 ##

刚刚毕业的医生只要满足资格要求且同时通过加拿大医务委员会资格考试（MCCQE)的第一部分和第二部分，就可以获得MCC颁发的加拿大医务委员会资格证（LMCC)，所有获得LMCC的人士都会被MCC登记在加拿大医学登记。

加拿大和美国以外的医学院校的毕业生（此处称之为国际医学毕业生IMG)和美国骨科医学院校的毕业生必须首先通过加拿大医务委员会评估考试（MCCEE)才可以参加加拿大医务委员会资格考试（MCCQE)第一部分。MCCEE考试豁免资格只针对持有加拿大或美国特殊证书的国际医学毕业生。

国家评估协会（NAC)专门安排考试检测住院医师培训入门必备的知识、技能和态度。该考试主要面向国际医学毕业生，主要形式是省级国际医学毕业生评估项目。

加拿大家庭医师学院（CFPC)和加拿大医务委员会（MCC)正在一起努力致建立一种全新的家庭医学资格考试。

### 考试准备资源 ###

**经常提问的问题**

应试者最好浏览一下**MCCEE经常提问的问题**页面。

**自我管理评估考试**

MCC提供的自我管理评估考试（SAE-EE)是一个包含96道多项选择题的在线实践考试，主要面向国际医学毕业生和打算检测自己的水平为MCCEE考试做准备的国际医学生。该考试在任何时间都有多种考试形式。尽管SAE-EE不涉及MCCEE所有材料，但是它提供的样题的类型和风格很可能出现在MCCEE中，所以，可以辅助MCCEE考试。所有的SAE-EE考试(包括EE 1、EE 2、EE 3、 EE 4和 EE 5)试题难度都一样。考试结束之后，你会马上收到考试结果邮件，得知自己回答正确的考题数量以及自己的考试表现和其他应试者的考试表现的比较。

**资格考试目标**

把资格考试目标作为学习指南，将有助于应试者准备MCCEE考试。**注意：** 资格考试目标包含在临床资料中。每个临床考试资料中都包含一套学习目标，这些实际上是所有MCC考试应试者都应该了解的。  

准备MCC考试时，应试者应该系统地学习每一个临床资料，并仔细阅读相关目标。当应试者感觉自己与某个具体目标相关的知识或技能比较薄弱时，就会知道要实现该目标就必须更加深入学习，学习医学文献/教科书。

**MCCEE在线测试**

**注意:** MCCEE在线测试当前版本旨在为应试者考试相关信息，目前正在处于更新状态，最新版本完成后将会第一时间在MCC官网发布。

MCCEE在线测试主要演示以计算机为基础的评估考试的操作流程。应试者可以浏览其中包含的一系列页面，熟悉一下计算机环境下的考试，了解每个考试特征，然后应用到真正的考试中。期间，他们将根据说明使用鼠标以及屏幕中的其他部分。  

MCCEE在线测试只包含10个样题，不提供正确答案，且不会对作答进行评分。考试的最后界面会出现**回顾题目**特点，并指出这些题目的哪些特点会出现在真正的考试中。**回顾题目**特点目前在MCCEE在线测试尚未激活，只是出现在**回顾题目**界面。

**多项选择样题**

网上可以进行MCCQE模拟考试，其中包含的多项选择题和MCCEE中的多项选择题类似。

**DSM-5过渡**

2013年5月美国精神病科协会发布了精神障碍诊断和统计手册的第五个版本（DSM-5)。  

从2014年到2015年，以计算机为基础的MCCEE考题将更新使用DSM-5最新语言，这些更新的考题将继续使用DSM-IV-TR语言，不同的一点是，其前面会附上DSM-5术语。  

据估计，2014年11月份的MCCEE考试将是第一次包含更新考题的MCCEE考试。

### 评分 - 飞出国 ###

加拿大医务委员会评估考试（MCCEE）是一个以计算机为基础的考试，考试时间4个小时，考试内容为180道多项选择题，其中包含150道计分的选择题和30道不计分的选择题。  

考试内容之所以包含30道不计分选择题，既是为了保证考试质量和/或为了满足调查需要，也是为了监督整个考试过程或一些考试问题的具体表现。尽管不计分的选择题不会计入最后分数或最后考试成绩，但是，它们并不被认为是不计分的选择题。所以，所有应试者都必须尽可能地好好回答每一个不计分的选择题。  

所有考试题都是根据能力需要进行制定的，所以每个考试题难度都不一样。应试者最后分数和合格/不合格结果会考虑考试题的难度以及应试者回答问题的准确程度。答错不扣分。所以，当你不确定时，最好尽量去猜一猜选项。

MCC记录考试分数时采用标准评分形式，所以，存在一些预定偏差和/或标准偏差。应试者合格/不合格结果的判定依据是其标准分数与考试规定的合格/不合格分数的比较。应试者的考试表现判断依据是与考试合格分数之间的比较，而不是其他应试者在考试中的表现。然而，应试者也可以比较自己的考试表现与其他应试者的考试表现，因为最后获得的标准分数将会为应试者提供一些这方面的信息。  

MCCEE考试分数标准评分范围为50分到500分，平均分数为271分左右，标准偏差为50分，但是合格分数一直都是250分。由于考试性质和考题难度分布的原因，考试分数不体现百分比。MCCEE考试分数在一定程度上可以通过平均分数来解读。例如，321分高于平均分271分一个标准偏差50分，371分高于平均分271分两个标准偏差100分。通常，MCCEE考试分数与平均分271分之间的差距反映了不同应试者在同一场考试中的表现差异。

MCC除了为应试者提供最后分数之外，还会对他们的考试表现进行反馈。MCC专门准备了辅助文档帮助应试者解读自己的MCCEE附加反馈报告。

**注意：**MCCEE考试在2007年之前采用的是不同的评分标准，所以，2007年之前MCCEE考试应试者的考试成绩评分标准不同于现在MCCEE考试应试者的考试成绩的评分标准。因此，2007年之前的MCCEE考试分数不应该和之后的MCCEE考试分数进行比较。

### 考试成绩 ###

**考试结果公布**

考试结束之后大约7周，应试者会收到一封电子邮件，通知其可以通过physiciansapply.ca个人账户查看自己合格/不合格考试结果。之后，应试者的physiciansapply.ca个人账户很快就会收到一份考试成绩单和一份补充性反馈报告。为了避免发生任何错误或欺诈行为，同时出于保密性的需要，考试结果将不会通过电话、传真或电子邮件公布。

**考试结果传递方式**

MCC通过physiciansapply.ca向应试者发送一份考试成绩单，该声明包含应试者最终考试结果、总分以及合格分数。除此之外，MCC还会通过physiciansapply.ca对应试者的考试表现进行反馈，并且还会提供一个辅助性文件，帮助应试者解读MCCEE补充性反馈报告。

当应试者申请的机构要求其提供一份考试成绩单或补充性反馈报告的认证复件，应试者可以向MCC申请发送认证复件。但是，该服务需要支付一定管理费用。

**考试失败**

尽管MCC不限制MCCEE应试者参加考试的次数，但是，通过考试的应试者不可以再次报考以期刷新考试成绩。

**请求重新评分**

只有没有通过考试的应试者才可以请求重新评分。未通过考试的应试者书面递交该请求，并且使用信用卡支付相关费用之后，必须等待长达3个月，该申请才能够获得批准。  

考试结束之后，最终考试结果至少经过3次核查才会发送给应试者。边缘分数，即靠近及格分数线的分数，接受的核查次数更多。  

鉴于MCC会额外审查边缘分数，所以重新评分之后也不可能改变最后的考试分数，只可能产生三种结果：考试分数不变；考试分数有所改变但是考试结果仍然不合格；考试分数有所改变，考试结果由不合格变成合格。重新评分之后，无论是考试分数发生了改变还是考试结果发生了改变，MCC都会通过应试者physiciansapply.ca个人账户重新签发考试成绩单和补充性反馈报告。

**投诉**

当MCCEE应试者被取消考试资格，包括以任何形式被拒绝报考将来的考试，或者认为考试结果有失公允时，可以向中央考试委员会提出投诉。应试者不可以对考试内容提出任何投诉。  

如果你打算提出投诉，必须在收到评估考试合作委员会决定之后45天之内书面通知执行董事。  

**MCCEE合格成绩有效期限**

MCCEE合格成绩有效期限为5年，这个政策于2005年11月被废止后，应试者的合格成绩便不再有任何限制。此外，2005年11月之前出具的MCCEE考试结果信件中所标明的有效日期也不再适用。该政策变化仅适用于曾经取得合格考试成绩的应试者，而不会考虑其参加考试的具体时间。  

加拿大教育管制机构了解该政策变化之后，就已经掌握了所有应试者的考试结果历史和当前考试状态。标明5年有效期限的MCCEE考试结果信件将不再重新签发。

> ### Scoring ###
> 
> The Medical Council of Canada Evaluating Examination (MCCEE) is a four-hour computer-based examination consisting of 180 multiple-choice questions. Of these 180 questions, 150 are scored questions and 30 are non-scored questions.
> 
> The 30 non-scored questions are included for quality assurance and/or research purposes, as well as to monitor the performance of the overall examination or specific test questions. While the non-scored questions do not count toward the final score or final result, they are not identified as non-scored questions. Candidates are encouraged to do as well as they can on every question.
> 
> Test questions are calibrated on an ability scale resulting in a difficulty being assigned to each question.The determination of each candidate’s final score and pass/fail result take into account the question difficulty, as well as whether or not the candidate answered the question correctly. Points are not deducted for incorrect answers. Therefore, it is always advantageous to make a “best guess” even when uncertain of an answer.
> 
> MCC examination scores are reported in a standard-score format, which are distributions scaled to have a predetermined mean and/or standard deviation. A candidate’s pass/fail result is based on where his or her standard score falls in relation to the pass/fail mark established for the examination. A candidate’s performance is judged in relation to the pass score for the examination and not judged on how well other individuals have performed on the examination. Candidates can, however, compare their performance to other candidates because standard scores also provide information on where a candidate stands in relation to other candidates.
> 
> The MCCEE results are reported on a standard-score scale that ranges from 50 to 500. The scores are reported on a scale on which the mean or average score is approximately 271, the standard deviation is 50, and the pass mark is always 250. Due to the nature of the examination and the different difficulty for each question, results are not presented as a percentage. The MCCEE scores can be interpreted in relation to the mean MCCEE score. For example, a score of 321 is one standard deviation above the mean score of 271 (271 + 50). A score of 371 is two standard deviations above the mean score of 271 (271 + (2*50)). The distance from the mean MCCEE score of 271 indicates, in general, how performance for one candidate relates to other candidates that have taken the same examination.
> 
> In addition to providing candidates with their final score, the MCC provides supplemental feedback on candidates’ examination performance. The MCC has prepared a help file to assist candidates in interpreting their MCCEE supplemental feedback report.
> 
> Note that the MCCEE was scored differently prior to 2007. Candidates who took the examination prior to 2007 would have had their scores established and reported differently than those of current candidates. As such, scores obtained prior to 2007 should not be compared to those obtained after this period. For more information, please contact us.
> 
> 
> http://mcc.ca/examinations/mccee/results/
> 
> ### Results ###
> 
> 
> **Release of results**
> 
> Approximately seven weeks after the last day of the examination session, candidates will receive an email notification stating that they can verify their pass/fail result through their physiciansapply.ca accounts. The Statement of Results and the supplemental feedback report will be posted in candidates’ physiciansapply.ca accounts shortly thereafter. In order to prevent errors or fraud and for reasons of confidentiality, results cannot be given over the phone, by fax or by email.
> 
> **How results are communicated**
> 
> The Medical Council of Canada (MCC) issues candidates a Statement of Results through their physiciansapply.ca account. The Statement of Results includes the candidate’s final result and total score as well as the score that was required to pass the examination. The MCC also provides supplemental feedback on candidates’ examination performance through their physiciansapply.ca accounts. The MCC has also prepared a help file to assist candidates in interpreting their MCCEE supplemental feedback report.
> Candidates applying to an organization that requires submission of certified copies of the Statement of Results or the supplemental feedback report can request that the MCC send certified copies. There is an administrative fee for this service.
> 
> **Fails**
> 
> The MCC does not limit the number of times a candidate may attempt the MCCEE. However, candidates with a pass result on the MCCEE cannot retake the examination in an attempt to obtain a higher score.
> 
> **Rescore requests**
> 
> Only candidates who have failed the MCCEE can request a rescoring of their examination; candidates with a pass result are not eligible for the rescoring service. Requests for a rescoring from candidates who failed the examination will be accepted up to three months following the date of the examination, upon receipt of a written request and a credit card payment of the applicable fee.
> 
> To request a rescore, see Rescoring by the MCC.
> 
> After the examination, final results are verified at least three times before being sent to candidates. Borderline results (i.e., those within a close range of the passing score) undergo increased review.
> 
> Given the additional scrutiny that the MCC gives to borderline results, it is unlikely that rescoring the examination will produce a change in result. Three potential outcomes can occur as a result of the rescoring of the examination: no change in score, change in score but no change in the fail result, or change in score and change in fail to pass result. If the rescoring produces a change in score or a change in final result and score, the MCC will issue a new Statement of Results and supplemental feedback report to the candidate through his or her physiciansapply.ca account.
> 
> 
> **Appeals**
> 
> Any MCCEE candidate who has been denied standing, including any denial of entry to future examinations, or who considers that the results of an examination have been prejudiced by the conduct of the examination may appeal to the Central Examination Committee. Candidates cannot seek to appeal the content on the examination.
> 
> Any candidate wishing to launch an appeal must notify the Executive Director in writing within 45 days of the decision of the Evaluating Examination Composite Committee. For more information on the appeal process for the MCCEE, please review the guidelines for appeal.
> 
> **Validity period of the MCCEE pass result**
> 
> In November 2005, the policy that limited the validity period of the MCCEE pass result to five years was abolished. Therefore, there are no longer any restrictions on a candidate’s pass result on the MCCEE. The expiry date on the MCCEE result letters issued prior to November 2005 no longer applies. This policy change applies only to candidates whose last MCCEE status is a pass result, regardless of when and how long ago the examination was taken.
> 
> The Canadian regulatory and educational bodies have been advised of this change and have access to candidates’ examination result history and current status. MCCEE result letters that refer to the five-year validity period will not be re-issued.
> 
> http://mcc.ca/examinations/nac-overview/
> 
> ## National Assessment Collaboration ##
> 
> The National Assessment Collaboration (NAC) is an alliance of Canadian organizations streamlining the evaluation process for international medical graduates (IMGs) seeking a licence to practise medicine in Canada.
> 
> The NAC examination assesses the readiness of an IMG for entrance into a Canadian residency program. It is a national, standardized examination that tests the knowledge, skills and attitudes essential for entrance into postgraduate training in Canada.
> 
> Comprising a series of clinical stations, the NAC examination presents typical clinical scenarios. The examination may include, but is not limited to, problems in medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics, gynecology, psychiatry and surgery.
> 
> Achieving a pass standing on this examination does not guarantee a training position in Canada. However, candidates receive feedback on their strengths and weaknesses as assessed in the examination. Candidates can then choose to share this information with program directors as part of their application to residency training programs.
> 
> All NAC examination candidates are, at a minimum, required to have passed the Medical Council of Canada Evaluating Examination (MCCEE) before being eligible to take the NAC examination. Some jurisdictions may add region-specific criteria.
> 
> The Canadian Resident Matching Service (CaRMS) accepts NAC examination results as part of match application packages. Please contact CaRMS for further information on its match application requirements.
> 
> The NAC examination is not a prerequisite to obtain the Licentiate of the Medical Council of Canada. However, depending on the provincial IMG assessment program, a pass result on the NAC examination may be a prerequisite for eligibility for residency training programs.
> 
> 
> The NAC examination can be taken at any of the examination sites and will be accepted by residency program directors regardless of where it was taken. Candidates do not have to take the examination in the province in which they will apply for residency.
> 
> For information regarding centre assignment, please visit the Centre selection page.
> 
> **Fees**
> 
> The Medical Council of Canada and the provincial programs offering the examination have worked together to establish a national fee which will apply to NAC examinations. For more information on the NAC examination fee, please visit the Examination and Service Fees page.
> 
> **Application to future NAC examination sessions**
> 
> To receive a notice when registration opens for future examination sessions, submit your email address below. The MCC will send this notification to your email address and not through your physiciansapply.ca account. The MCC cannot guarantee that the email notification will reach your inbox.

### 报名资格 - 飞出国 ###

**资格**

**针对第一次报名的报名者的要求**

- 应试者必须是:
  - 国际医学毕业生;
  - 国际医学专业学生;
  - 美国骨科医学院校毕业生; 或者
  - 美国骨科医学院校学生。
- 应试者必须已经顺利通过加拿大医务委员会评估考试（MCCEE)
  - 应试者必须首先参加MCCEE考试，判断自己是否具备足够的基本医学知识参加NAC考试。
  - 该要求确保只有那些最有可能通过考试的人士才会在加拿大参加NAC考试，并支付相关费用。  
    - 医学学生
        - 在报考MCCEE考试时，递交过学生证明表的应试者，不必再次递交学生证明表。
            - 但是，递交学生证明表之后，无论发生任何变化都需要递交其他表格，反映变化的情况。  
    - 医学毕业生
        - 报考MCCEE考试之后才毕业的毕业生，必须通过physiciansapply.ca个人账户为自己的学历/学位建立资源验证请求,并且必须递交一份学历/学位证复件。  

**针对重考者的要求**

- NAC考试每年只举行一次。  
- 自2011年起，每个人最多只能报考3次NAC考试。  
- 自2005年起，凡是NAC考试合格的应试者将不能再次报考该考试。  
- 2011年之后（包括2011年当年）没有通过该考试的应试者，可以报考一年一次的NAC考试，但最多只可以报考3次。  
- 应试者最近的考试结果将长期有效。如果应试者参加该考试不止一次，那么，只有最近的考试结果才有效。  

**NAC考试报名**


- 应试者可以通过physiciansapply.ca个人账户在具体报名时间段内报考NAC考试。  
- 注意：只有在具体报名时间段内且应试者符合所有报考条件时，其physiciansapply.ca个人账户才会出现报考该考试的选项。  

**考试报名处理**

报名申请处理时间至少需要3周。

- 一旦系统确认考试资格证明文件已经接受MCC审查并获得其认可，很快你就会通过其他途径得知自己的考试申请已经获得批准。  

**打算2016年1月1日入驻加拿大的应试者可以选择参加MCCEE考试和NAC考试的具体时间**

1. 即将于2016年春天毕业的应试者可以在毕业时间之前20个月，也就是2014年秋天报考MCCEE考试。 之前的要求是医学院校学生可以在毕业前12个月报考MCCEE考试。之所以时间限制由12个月变更到20个月，是为了方便国际医学毕业生可以在CaRMS截止时间之前同时报考MCCEE考试和NAC考试。  

1. 一旦MCCEE报考申请通过，应试者就必须参加2015年3月份的MCCEE考试。因为对于希望在2016年3月1日之前参加NAC考试的应试者来说，2015年3月份的MCCEE考试是最后一次机会。  

凡是2015年3月或更早参加过MCCEE考试并且已经获得合格成绩的应试者可以在2015年春天报考2015年9月份的NAC考试。  

1. 2015年9月份的考试结果将会在CaRMS报考2016年3月份R-1 Residency过程中及时公布。

以下内容来源：http://mcc.ca/examinations/nac-overview/scheduling/

### 选择考试中心 ###

**选择考试中心**

- 在线报考NAC考试时，你可以按照优先次序选择3个考试中心。MCC会尽力满足你优先选择的考试中心。如果你只选择一个考试中心，那么，你被安排到一个具体考试中心的可能性不会更大。
- 只有蒙特利尔考试中心的NAC考试才采取法语和英语两种语言。考试报名时，你必须选择自己在蒙特利尔考试中心参加考试所使用的语言。  
- NAC考试可以在任何考试地点参加，而且，不论在哪儿参加考试，都可以获得移民项目的认可。所以，应试者参加考试的地点并不局限于他们申请移民的省份。  

**考试中心安排**

- 考试中心安排之后，所有合格的应试者都会在7月初收到一份通知。该通知将告诉你怎样通过个人账户查看考试中心安排。
- 之后大约2周，所有应试者还会收到另一份通知。该通知将告诉你目前可以通过个人账户查看准考证，此外，还会告诉你如何查看和打印准考证。
- 尽管MCC通过与IMG项目合作尽量满足应试者考试中心要求，但是，MCC不能保证能安排到优先选择的考试中心。  
- 报名期间，当你选择考试中心之后，必须明确一点，如果MCC不能为你安排你优先选择的考试中心，是否接受安排的其他考试中心。  
  - 报名期间，如果你明确表示自己不会考虑其他考试中心，那么，如果MCC不能为你安排你优先选择的考试中心，你的考试申请将被取消，部分可退还的NAC考试费将会退回你的个人账户。  
  - 报名期间，如果你明确表示自己可以考虑其他考试中心，那么你将会被安排到最近的考试中心。  
- 考试中心确定之后，有关2015年9月份考试的考试中心更改请求必须在2015年7月23日星期四之前递交给MCC，才有可能被考虑。  

**安排冲突(考试中心安排)**

如果考试中心安排与自己有很大的冲突，你必须通过个人账户递交相关信息，并同时递交辅助性文件。该请求获得批准之后，你将必须支付一定考试中心更改费用。  

**请求更改考试中心**

- 你可以考虑请求更改2015年9月份考试的考试中心，但前提是，书面请求必须在2015年7月23日星期四之前递交给MCC，并且，申请的考试中心尚有可用考试座位。  
- 考试中心更改请求获得批准之后，你将必须通过个人账户支付一定相关费用。  
- 不允许更改考试时间。  
  - 例如，你本来是参加2015年9月份的考试，但是，你打算把考试推迟到2016年3月份或更晚的考试，在这种情况下，你将不得不取消报考申请，再次申请报考该考试。  

注意: 考试中心安排工作启动之后，发生变动的可能性极小。

>   - International medical graduate;
>   - International medical student;
>   - Graduate of a U.S. School of Osteopathic Medicine; or
>   - Student of a U.S. School of Osteopathic Medicine.
> - Candidates must also have passed the Medical Council of Canada Evaluating Examination (MCCEE)
>   - Candidates need to take the MCCEE first to determine whether they have the basic medical knowledge for the NAC exam.
>   - This requirement ensures that only those who are most likely to have success incur the expenses related to taking the NAC exam in Canada.
>     - Students
>         - Candidates are not required to resubmit a Student Attestation Form if they already did so when applying for the MCCEE.
>             - However, if there are changes since submitting the Student Attestation Form, another form will be required reflecting the changes.
>     - Graduates
>         - Candidates who graduated since applying for the MCCEE must create a source verification request (SVR) for their diploma/degree through their physiciansapply.ca account and submit a copy of their diploma/degree.

> 
> **Centre selection**
> 
> - When applying for the National Assessment Collaboration (NAC) examination online, you can choose three examination centres in order of preference. The MCC will make every attempt to accommodate your exam centre preference. The likelihood of being assigned to a particular centre does not improve if you choose only one centre.
> - The NAC exam is offered both in French and in English only at the Montreal centre and is identified as Montreal (EN/FR). At time of registration, you must designate in which language you want to take the exam at the Montreal exam site.
> - The NAC examination can be taken at any of the examination sites and will be accepted by residency program directors regardless of where it was taken. Candidates do not have to take the examination in the province in which they will apply for residency.

> - A message will be sent by early July to all accepted candidates once the examination centres have been assigned. This message will explain how to view your centre assignment through your account.
> - Approximately two weeks following centre assignment, a message will be sent to all candidates informing them that their entrance card package is now available through their account, and instructions on how to view and print the entrance card package will be provided in this message.
> - In collaboration with IMG partner programs, the Medical Council of Canada (MCC) makes every effort to accommodate candidates’ centre choices; however, the MCC cannot guarantee assignment to your preferred centre.
> - Once you have chosen your centres during the online application, you must indicate whether or not you would accept assignment to another centre in the event that the MCC cannot assign you to one of your centre choices:
>   - If you indicated, during the online application, that you did not wish to consider other centres, and the MCC cannot assign you to one of your centres, your application will be withdrawn and the refundable portion of the NAC examination fee paid (i.e., the examination fee minus the withdrawal examination fee) will be credited to your account.
>   - If you indicated, during the online application, that you would accept assignment to other centers, you will be assigned to the nearest available centre.
> - Once a centre has been assigned, a request for a change of examination centre for the September 2015 session will be considered only if received by Thursday, July 23, 2015.

> 
> **Centre change request**
> 
> - A centre change request will be considered for the September 2015 session, provided that a written request is submitted to the MCC by Thursday, July 23, 2015 and space is available at the requested centre.
> - The applicable centre change fee will be charged to your account only if the change can be accommodated.
> - You cannot “change” examination sessions.
>   - For example, if you are assigned to take the examination in the September session and you wish to delay taking the examination until the March 2016 session or beyond, you will need to withdraw your application and reapply.
> 
> Note: Opportunities for change are very limited once the centre assignment process has taken place.

### OSCE考点描述 ###

鉴于不同临床情景表现不同，临床国家评估合作（NAC)考试专门设立了一系列检查点。在一个具体考试中，每个应试者都会在同一个系列的不同检查点间走动，其中包括不计入最后分数的试点。每个检查点检查都需要11分钟，各检查点之间的检查时间间隔2分钟。**注意：**自2014年起，OSCE考试将包含治疗学知识评估环节。该考试不包含任何纸质考试。

每个检查点都会有一个简要书写说明，介绍临床疾病，概述应试者的任务,例如，了解患者病史，进行身体检查等等。此外，每个检查点都还会有至少一个标准化病人和一个监考医师。标准化病人，指健康人士或者患有慢性疾病的人士，根据可靠检查，他们都有病人病人迹象和/或症状。应试者必须和标准化病人接触，因为这些将是他们自己的病人，包括不考虑性别对他们进行全面身体检查。大多数即将接受身体检查的标准化病人都穿着病号服，但是在考试阶段他们会把病号服脱掉。与标准化病人接触也包括像对待真正病人一样询问他们的病例，并回答他们对自己病例的一些提问。与标准化病人的接触只是监考医师评估的一部分。

通常，你不能和监考医师进行任何交流。当监考医师认为你的方向错了，他/她会给你提示，例如，在体检处你却一直回答病史相关问题。当他们认为该标准化病人身上存在问题时，还可能介入其中。

监考医师负责观察病人的疾病。在大多数检查点，应试者都必须首先检查标准化病人，检查过后8分钟，监考医师会向应试者提问一系列有关该病人的标准化的问题，应试者必须就这些问题进行口头作答。贴在门上的或者在考场内的应试者说明会说明在这八分钟内监考医师是否会向应试者口头提问。

尽管每个检查点都有许多与评估有关的事项，但是，你不必进行所有的事项，只需要关注与自己相关的具体任务以及指定的病人疾病。例如，当你为急性发作呼吸短促病人做身体检查时，你将面临的挑战是在检查点规定的时间内，必须判断、组织并实施适用于该标准化病人呼吸困难程度的身体检查。该考试的关键在于在有限时间内能够根据有限的信息判断如何处理病人疾病。 

监考医师可能会参与检查为你提供相关信息或结果。例如，在身体检查环节，可能会有指定检查医师读取血压值或眼底检查结果，只有你开始检查之后，他们才能这么做，且必须严格执行评分工具说明。这样做的目的是为你节省时间，以便继续身体检查的其他环节。

同样地，监考医师只会出现在有预约测试或检查的检查点，为这些预约测试或检查提供结果。但是，并不是所有预约的测试或检查都会有结果。即使这些测试或检查没有任何结果，预约也很重要，因为一些实验室检查很可能需要预约。

有些考试管理部门还会有观察员或其他监考员，他们负责保证考试质量以及后续评估工作。

> ### OSCE station description ###
> 
> The National Assessment Collaboration (NAC) examination consists of a series of stations based on presentations of clinical scenarios. For a given administration, each candidate rotates through the same series of stations including pilot stations that do not count towards a candidate’s final score. Each station is 11 minutes in length with two minutes between stations. Note: As of 2014,Therapeutic knowledge will be assessed within the OSCE portion of the examination. There is no longer a written component to this exam.
> 
> At each station, a brief written statement introduces a clinical problem and outlines the candidate’s tasks (e.g. take a history, perform a physical examination, etc.). In each station, there is at least one standardized patient and a physician examiner. A standardized patient is either a healthy person or a person with chronic stable findings who has been trained to present a real patient’s signs and/or symptoms in a reliable and consistent manner. Candidates should interact with standardized patients as they would with their own patients. This includes draping a patient as appropriate for different elements of a physical examination (regardless of their gender). Most standardized patients that are to be physically examined are already in hospital gowns, but the gowns may be removed as part of the examination. Interacting with standardized patients also includes questioning them and responding to their problems, as you would with a real patient. Your interaction with the standardized patient is part of what the physician examiner is assessing.
> 
> In general, you will not interact with the physician examiner. An examiner may prompt you once if he or she believes that you have misunderstood the directions; e.g., you are pursuing a history during the physical examination station. They may also intervene if they believe there is a problem for the standardized patient.
> 
> The physician examiner observes the patient encounter. For most stations, the candidate will be asked to respond to a series of standardized oral questions asked by the physician examiner after eight minutes with the standardized patient. The candidate instructions (posted on the door and in the room) will indicate whether there are physician examiner oral questions at the eight-minute mark or not.
> 
> It is not your ability to do and be all things at each station that contributes to a good assessment; it is your ability to focus on the assigned task, as well as the given patient problem. For example, if you are asked to conduct a focused physical examination on a patient with acute onset of shortness of breath, the challenge is to prioritize, organize and conduct a physical examination that is appropriate to the degree of respiratory distress presented by the standardized patient in the time allowed for the station. The ability to decide what is necessary for a patient problem, given limited information and time, is critical to success on the examination.
> 
> Physician examiners may intervene to provide you with information or results. For instance, in a physical examination station, a physician examiner may be directed to give a blood pressure reading or results of an ophthalmoscopic examination. They can only do this if they are so instructed by the scoring instruments and only if you have initiated the examination maneuver. The intention is to save you time by allowing you to move on to other sections of the physical examination.
> 
> Similarly, physician examiners may provide results for some tests. This only occurs at those stations where you are expected to order tests or investigations. However, results are not given for all the tests or investigations that are ordered. This point is important, as ordering a certain laboratory investigation may be a correct procedure, even if no results are forthcoming.
> 
> In some administrations there may be observers or second examiners. These individuals are introduced as part of the quality assurance process and for ongoing assessment.

### 考试当天 - 飞出国 ###

**设备**

考试当天你必须携带这些东西：

- 没有任何大学或医院标致的纯白色实验服
- 听诊器
- 反射锤

这些设备必须装在实验服口袋中，因为考试现场禁止携带任何袋子。

**注意:**所有个人物品都必须登记，例如，钥匙、纸张、笔、钱包、手机、掌上电脑以及外套，考试之前存放起来。尽管工作人员会竭尽全力保证你的个人物品安全，但是，MCC并不负责这些个人物品的安全，所以，请尽可能少带些个人物品。考场会提供铅笔和橡皮，因为考试时你会需要铅笔和橡皮。

**现场登记与情况介绍**

如果现场登记迟到超过15分钟，你将很可能无法参加考试。  

考试当天现场登记之后是考试情况介绍，你会得知有关此次考试的一些细节，此外，你还会有机会提问题。每个考试考点都是配有专门工作人员，确保你在整个考试过程中都可以获得必要的指导。  

一旦应试者选择开始考试，即使没有完成考试，也算作进行了考试。

**考试安全**

应试者之间禁止交流；  
OSCE考试一旦开始，考点就会马上处于与外界隔离的状态（考点工作人员除外）；  
禁止携带一切电子设备，包括智能手表；  
考试期间禁止使用一切通讯设备，包括手机在内。  

违反这些规定可能会导致被拒绝参加该考试，还可能会导致此次考试成绩无效，甚至会导致以后都不能再参加该考试。

**应试者身份**

现场登记时，你会收到一些条形码标签，上面印有应试者身份编号。每到下一个检查点，你必须把标签交给监考医师，他们会把标签贴在评分工具上。此外，你还必须带感光识别证，标明自己的身份编号和开始位置编号。

**应试者记事本**

考试时MCC会提供一个小笔记本，你可以用来记笔记。MCC只提供一个笔记本，不会提供额外纸张。在笔记本上记得笔记不参与评分。笔记本封面上会贴着个人身份标签。离开考场时必须完整返还这个小册子，纸张或其他部分不能有任何损坏或丢失。  

**投诉与利益冲突**

如果应试者认为考试期间出现的一些管理、环境或者个人健康问题很可能会严重影响自己的考试成绩，那么，他/她必须：  

- 在考场及时将这些障碍告知主监考官；
- 事件发生后，在考试中心填写一份事件报告；
- 考试结束之后一周内，登陆个人账户递交有关该事件的详细描述。

考试过程中应试者必须出示障碍/问题通知才可以打断考试。截止时间过后，包括考试成绩已经公布，考试当天出现的所有障碍将停止调查。

如果考试之前你担心存在可能的利益冲突，最好考试之前联系MCC。考试期间，当你发现与监考官或标准化病人存在冲突时，必须：  

- 离开考场并马上通知工作人员，工作人员得到通知后，会为你做相应调整；
- 考试结束之后一周内，登陆个人账户递交有关该事件的详细描述。

出现下列情况时，MCC会认为应试者与监考官或标准化病人之间存在利益冲突：  
- 与应试者存在血缘关系或者婚姻关系；  
- 目前或一直以来与应试者存在重大业务往来或者社会关系，或者是应试者的专业同事；  
- 应试者与监考官或者标准化病人存在已得到证实的利益冲突，例如，在其他环境下存在严重投诉。  

注意： 一般应试者与监考官或标准化病人之间互相认识就会被视为存在利益冲突。  

**终止考试**

所有打算终止考试的应试者在考试当天都会被要求填写一份标准弃权表格。  

**考试持续时间**

考试当天在考场会有一个相关情况介绍，还会张贴一些指示，这些都可以帮助你只专注自己的考试表现，不需浪费精力找考场。此外，附近还会有工作人员提供指导，有任何疑问都可以咨询附近工作人员。

该考试总时间大约6.5个小时到7小时，包括现场登记、情况介绍以及其他可能隔离时间。在整个考试中，OSCE大约3个小时。  

**11分钟的检查点**

在OSCE，你必须：  

- 获得病例和/或执行身体检查；  
- 解决病人与考试结果、诊断或者医疗问题相关的困扰；  
- 在大众医疗诊所或急诊室中处理病人疾病。  

提前完成接诊病人环节之后，你必须安静等待。如果你突然发现自己还有一些事情尚未完成，在时间截止之前你可以随时再次接诊病人。口试一旦开始，你就不可以再接触病人，即使离该检查点结束还有一些时间。结束铃声一响，你必须离开该检查点，到下一检查点，不可以提前离开检查点。  

你不需要进行任何外生殖器检查或肠检，这是出于对标准化病人的尊重，而且，考试时间也不允许。当你认为某个检查点可以进行这样的检查时，必须通知监考医师。如果临床诊断或者口试环节需要一些调查结果，监考医师会为你提供这些材料。  

尽管通常应试者会被希望直接与标准化病人接触，包括直接提问问题、进行身体检查和解释药方，但是，体检检查点需要采取不同的方式。进行身体检查时，你必须简要说明自己正在做的事情，并报告自己的检查结果，因为这是获得满分的一个重要环节。例如，你只有说明自己在检查病人，监考医师才可以为病人检查环节打分。检查过程中的所有发现（包括面色苍白）都必须报告给监考官，证明自己发现了这一点。如果你在检查过程中没有任何确切的发现，你可以报告一切正常。监考医师不能做任何假设，例如，应试者在寻找面色苍白、炎症、皮疹。同样地，监考医师必须根据你报告的检查发现（无论正确还是错误）进行打分。  

**检查点之间的流动**

应试者有一定的时间转向下一个检查点并阅读张贴的考试说明。在这段时间内，监考医师为测试下一位应试者准备仪器。应试者必须从纸上撕下一个条形码身份标签，准备交给监考医师。考试铃声一响，你就可以进入考场进行规定的任务。  

**应试者说明**

请仔细阅读每个检查点的考试说明。例如，在体检检查点，你必须接诊病人，并且当你实施个人认为合适的检查操作时，必须同时向病人和监考医师报告自己正在做的事情以及所有检查发现。在体检检查点，你只可以向病人提问与检查本身直接相关的问题，例如，“你抬胳膊时感觉疼吗？”，其他任何细节性问题病人都不允许作答。提问问题不参与评分，但是会使用一些在该检查点的有限时间。相反地，你也不可以在病史检查点进行任何体检操作。  

在组合病史/体检检查点或者管理检查点，即所做的任务对处理病人疾病必不可少，那么，你可以自行决定这两个（或更多）任务中的哪些因素必须优先考虑。   

每个检查点都会同时在考场门口和考场内张贴考试说明，包括病人名字和年龄、所患疾病、考试背景（大众医疗诊所或急诊室）以及该检查点的性质（病史检查点还是体检检查点）。考场可能会提供重要提示、检查结果和/或家庭病例，在等待进入检查点时，你可以做一些笔记。  

下面是临床检查点的应试者说明的一个例子：  

Jonathan Jones，男，65岁，一直腹痛。  

- 接下来的8分钟：  

进行一次定向相关身体检查  

- 进行身体检查过程中  

向监考官解释自己正在做的事情并描述自己的检查发现  

- 8分钟提示铃响后，监考官会提问一些有关该病人的问题  

- 交给监考官一个标签  

这些说明中的一个关键词是**定向**。你进行的身体检查必须和评估的腹痛相关。在病史获得方面没有任何要求，也不会参与评分，身体检查的方式和执行的具体操作除外。  

**有关考试材料或考试内容的保密性**

考试流程包括同意不向其他任何人传播或透漏考试材料和考试内容，因此你不可以在任何时间以任何方式讨论或透漏考试内容，包括病人描述、检查发现、口试问题、病例等等，即使是考试结束之后也不可以。  

违反保密协议的例子包括但不局限于，把病人的反应与同事进行对比，与将来影视则交流考试内容，以及在网上发布信息。  

MCC积极监控违反保密协议的行为，并且对透漏考试内容的应试者采取相应的纪律和法律手段。凡是同意遵守保密协议却违反该协议向外传播考试内容的行为都将被视为极度不专业行为。  

违反保密协议向外传播考试内容的应试者不但被取消考试成绩，其行为还会上报管理机构以及其他医疗组织，更严重的是，以后都不能再参加所有MCC考试。

> The equipment must be carried in lab coat pockets, as no bags will be allowed.
> 
> NOTE: All personal belongings will be collected at registration (e.g., keys, papers, pens and pencils, wallets, cell phones, PDAs, as well as coats) and stored until after the examination. While every effort will be made to store your belongings safely, the Medical Council of Canada (MCC) is not responsible for these belongings and you are encouraged to bring as few personal belongings as possible.
> 
> You will be provided pencils (with erasers) at the site. You will be required to use the pencils (with erasers) provided at the site.
> 
> 
> **Registration and orientation**
> 
> If you are more than 15 minutes late for registration, you may be denied entry to the examination.
> 
> Immediately following registration on examination day, you will attend an orientation to the examination. The orientation provides you with the logistical details of the examination and an opportunity to ask questions. Each examination site is staffed to ensure that you are guided through the examination.
> 
> Once a candidate chooses to begin the examination, it will count as an attempt even if he/she cannot finish.
> 
> **Examination security**
> 
> No talking between candidates is permitted:
> Once the OSCE has begun, up until sequestering
> Between stations (except with site staff)
> All electronic devices are not permitted (including smartwatches)
> Access to communication devices, including telephones or cell phones, during the exam and sequestering is not permitted
> Breaking the rules may result in dismissal from the examination, may invalidate your results and you may be barred from taking future MCC examinations.
> 
> **Candidate identification**
> 
> Candidate identification numbers are printed on bar code labels that are distributed to you at registration. You are asked to give a label to the physician examiners as you proceed from station to station. The physician examiners, in turn, attach the label to your scoring instruments. In addition, you are required to wear a photographic identification badge, which also indicates your ID number and start location number.
> 
> **Candidate notebooks**
> 
> The MCC provides a small notebook that you may use for writing notes while taking the examination. Only one notebook will be provided and no pages can be added. The notes in the notebook will not be scored. Your ID label is attached to the notebook cover. This booklet must be returned intact at the checkout (including unused labels), i.e., no pages or parts can be torn or ripped out.
> 
> 
> **Complaints and conflict of interest**
> 
> 
> A candidate who believes that administrative, environmental or personal health problems encountered during the course of an examination session may significantly affect his/her results must:
> 
> - Immediately communicate such concerns to the Chief Examiner on site at the time of the examination session in question
> - Complete an incident report at the exam centre as soon as possible after the incident
> - Submit a message through your account detailing the incident within one week following the examination
> 
> Any intervention, if appropriate, is possible only if notice of the concern/problem is presented by the candidate in this manner. Concerns relating to exam day occurrences cannot be investigated after this deadline including once results have been released.
> 
> If you have concerns about a potential conflict of interest prior to the examination, you are strongly encouraged to contact the MCC before exam day. If, during the examination, you encounter an examiner or standardized patient where a conflict exists, you should:
> 
> - Exit the station and inform the staff immediately (once staff are notified, they will make alternate arrangements for the administration of the specific station for you)
> - Submit a message through your account informing the MCC of the occurrence within one week of the examination
> 
> The MCC takes the view that a conflict of interest exists, without limitation, in situations where the examiner or standardized patient is (i) related by blood or marriage to the candidate; (ii) is or has been in a significant business or social relationship with the candidate, or is a professional colleague; or (iii) where a conflict of interest relating to the candidate and such examiner or standardized patient has been previously identified (e.g., there is an outstanding complaint in another context). Please note that knowing or being known to an examiner or standardized patient is not generally deemed a conflict of interest.
> 
> **Discontinuation of examination**
> 
> 
> All candidates who choose to discontinue the examination will be asked to sign a standard waiver form on exam day.
> 
> **Navigating the examination and duration**
> 
> 
> Remember that there is an orientation at the examination site on the day itself. Signs will be posted and a considerable effort is made to allow you to focus on your performance, not on finding the next room. Staff will always be nearby to provide directions. If in doubt, ask the nearest staff person for directions.
> 
> The examination includes registration of candidates, an orientation session and sometimes a sequestering period for a total time of approximately six and a half to seven hours. Of the total time, the OSCE is approximately three hours in length.
> 
> **Eleven-minute stations**
> 
> In OSCE stations, you may be required to:
> 
> - Obtain a history and/or conduct a physical examination
> - Address patient concerns regarding results, a diagnosis or a medical problem
> - Manage a patient problem in a family practice clinic or in an Emergency Department setting
> 
> If you finish the patient encounter early, you must wait quietly. If you remember something more that you would like to do, you may re-engage the patient at any time until the warning bell/announcement or final 11-minute buzzer/announcement depending on the station. After the oral questions begin, you may not return to the patient encounter, even if there is time remaining before the end of the station. After the final bell sounds, you must leave the station and move to the next one. You may not leave early.
> 
> You are not expected to carry out genital or rectal examinations. This is out of respect for the standardized patients and the short time allotted to each station. In a station where you believe that such an examination is appropriate, you should inform the physician examiner. If there are relevant findings needed to complete the clinical encounter, or answer the oral questions, the physician examiner will provide these findings to you.
> 
> Although it is always expected that candidates will interact directly with the standardized patients (asking questions directly, conducting a physical examination, explaining a prescription), physical examination stations require a somewhat different strategy. While conducting a physical examination, you should state briefly what you are doing and report your findings. This is critical to receiving full credit. For instance, a physician examiner cannot give credit for observing the patient unless you state that you are observing the patient. If there are findings; for example, pallor, then report this to the examiner to indicate that you have noted it. If you observe that there are no positive findings, then you can just report “Normal”. A physician examiner is not allowed to assume, for example, that a candidate is looking for pallor, inflammation, skin rashes. Likewise, credit for findings (positive or negative) cannot be given unless you report what you found.
> 
> **Moving from station to station**
> 
> A set amount of time is allowed for moving to the next station and for reading the posted instructions. During this time, the physician examiner completes the rating instrument for the current candidate and prepares for the next candidate. Remove one bar code identification label from the sheet, so it is ready to give to the physician examiner. At the sound of the buzzer, you enter the room and proceed with the required task.
> 
> **Candidate instructions**
> 
> Read the instructions for each station carefully. For instance, in a physical examination station, you must greet the patient and report what you are doing and report your findings (to both the patient and the physician examiner) as you carry out those examination manoeuvers that you deem appropriate. It is not appropriate to ask questions to the patient during a physical examination station unless the questions relate directly to the examination itself; for example, “Does it hurt when you raise your arm?” Patients are discouraged from answering other questions in any detail. There is no credit given for asking questions and doing so will use some of the limited time available for that station. Conversely, it is not appropriate to carry out any physical examination manoeuvers in a history station.
> 
> In a combined history/physical examination station or a management station (i.e., doing whatever tasks are necessary to manage the patient’s problem at that moment), it is up to you to prioritize the elements of the two (or more) tasks.
> 
> The instructions for each station are posted next to the door and are available inside each room. The instructions provide the patient’s name and age, the presenting problem, the setting (family practice clinic or Emergency Department), and the nature of the station, be it a history and/or physical. Vital signs, test results and/or elements of the family history may be provided. You are allowed to take notes while waiting to enter a station.
> 
> The following is an example of instructions to candidates for a clinical station:
> 
> Jonathan Jones, a 65-year-old man, presents to your office because he has been experiencing abdominal pain.
> 
> - IN THE NEXT 8 MINUTES:
> CONDUCT A FOCUSED AND RELEVANT PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
> 
> - As you proceed with the physical examination,
> EXPLAIN TO THE EXAMINER what you are doing and DESCRIBE ANY FINDINGS.
> 
> - After the 8-minute warning buzzer, the examiner will ask you some questions related to this patient.
> 
> - GIVE ONE LABEL TO THE EXAMINER
> 
> A key word in the instructions is FOCUSED. You are expected to conduct a physical examination relevant to assessing abdominal pain. There is no requirement (and no marks are given) for obtaining a history, only for the manner of the physical examination and for the specific manoeuvers that are performed.
> 
> **Confidentiality of examination materials or content**
> 
> As part of the exam process, you agree not to disseminate or reveal to others the examination materials and content. This means that you cannot discuss or disclose exam content (including patient portrayals and findings, oral questions, cases, etc.) at any time in any way even after the examination ends.
> 
> Examples of breaches in confidentiality include, but are not limited to, comparing patient responses with your colleagues, sharing content with future exam candidates and posting information online.
> 
> The MCC actively monitors for breaches in confidentiality, and will seek disciplinary and legal measures against candidates who disclose examination content. Agreeing to maintain confidentiality and then breaking that confidentiality by disseminating exam content is considered a highly unprofessional act.
> 
> Breaking confidentiality and disseminating exam content can lead to candidates being denied a standing on the examination and being reported to regulatory authorities and to other medical organizations, and being barred from taking MCC exams in the future.

### 考试准备资料 - 飞出国 ###

NAC考试对国际医学毕业生应试者的能力进行评估。具体说来，也就是加拿大研究生培养入门必须具备的知识、技能和态度。下面的资源将有助于应试者准备NAC考试。  

**考试当天**

尽管该考试持续时间大约3个小时，但是应试者参与考试管理的时间是6.5个小时到7个小时。为了安全起见，一些城市的应试者可能需要在考试之前的某个具体时间点到达考试地点，且一直在考试地点等待考试开始。考试到来之前，应试者可以在报名信息中仔细阅读具体的说明。  

所有应试者都必须在模拟临床情境下参加考试，必须随身携带一件纯白色实验服、一个听诊器、一个反射锤。为了全面了解NAC考试有关规定，应试者应该仔细阅读在考试当天应该遵守的规定。  

** MCC参考资料 **

NAC考试应试者最好能够了解一下在客观结构化临床考试中经常出现的错误。  

**《资格考试考试目标》**

应试者使用《资格考试考试目标》作为学习指南将有助于NAC考试报考。《资格考试考试目标》不仅是MCCEE考试和MCCQE考试第一部分和第二部分的基础，还对NAC考试中可能出现的考试材料进行了总体概括。**注意：**《资格考试考试目标》编制的内容涉及一些临床表现。    

**DSM-5过渡**

2013年5月美国精神病协会出版了《精神障碍诊断与统计手册》（第五版），即DSM-5。  

2014年到2015年，以计算机为基础的MCCEE考题将陆续更新使用最新DSM-5语言。这些更新的考题将仍然使用DSM-IV-TR语言，只不过这些语言将会附在DSM-5术语之后。  

应试者回答监考医生提问的问题时，既可以使用DSM-5语言也可以使用DSM-IV-TR语言。  

**参考书目**

考试之前，如果你不熟悉北美疾病管理实践，可以查阅由加拿大药剂师协会出版、Jean Gray主编的《治疗选择》，获取一些基本信息。  

**有关国际医学毕业生的一般信息** 

国际医学毕业生还可以在**国际医学毕业生**页面查看有关获得医学实践许可的流程的**概览**版块，了解如何在加拿大获得医学实践许可。

### 评分 ###

**概述**

NAC考试目标主要通过使用标准化考试管理准则、培训监考医师和标准化病例以及使用预定的评分工具来实现。监考医师针对每位应试者在每个检查点的表现对其OSCE分数进行评估。  

为了通过NAC考试，应试者必须获得一个符合加拿大医学院校毕业生特定标准的整体分数。最后考试结果评定阶段，NAC考试委员会还会考虑监考医师对应试者在道德和专业方面的能力的观察结果。

**在NAC考试中如何对OSCE进行评分？**

监考医师首先观察应试者与标准化病人之间的接触，然后对应试者在发现问题和完成临床任务方面能力进行评分，具体包括病史理解、身体检查、组织技巧、沟通技巧、语言流畅性、诊断、数据解读、调查以及治疗与管理这9项能力。OSCE分数是监考医师能力评分的平均分。所以，应试者OSCE分数是各个检查点分数平均分

**NAC分数采用什么样的报告形式?**

NAC考试分数分布于0到100分之间。合格分数标准是加拿大医学院校毕业生的表现。应试者考试表现依据该考试的合格分数进行判断，而不考虑其他应试者的表现。  

应试者除了得知自己总分数外，还会收到有关自己考试表现的补充性反馈报告。该报告中包含一个图表，说明应试者在各个能力方面的具体表现。  

由于能力分数不是在观察的基础上得出的，所以，能力分数和整体分数在准确性方面存在差异。  

**自2015年起关于补充性反馈报告的变化**

之前的补充性反馈报告包含一个图表，该图表依据考试表现好坏依次列出各个检查点。自2015年起，MCC将该图表从补充性反馈报告中删除，因为图表包含的信息尽管正确但容易解读错误和/或容易误导人。  

该图表将各个检查点划分了等级，但是，实际上应试者在各个检查点的表现在某些情况下是相同（接近相同）或者没有差异的。 出现这样的变动之后，2015年的补充性反馈报告将由2页内容变成1页内容。

以下内容来源： http://mcc.ca/examinations/nac-overview/results/

###考试成绩 ###

**考试成绩公布**

**重要提示:** 考试之后6周到8周，通过physiciansapply.ca account个人账户可以查看考试成绩。所以，9月12日和13日参加考试的应试者回比9月19日和20日参加考试的应试者早些收到考试结果。  

NAC考试委员会负责确认考试成绩，MCC负责于考试之后6周到8周通过physiciansapply.ca公布考试成绩。此外，MCC还负责通过physiciansapply.ca对应试者的考试表现进行补充性反馈。之后，应试者的考试成绩将与CaRMS以及其他physiciansapply.ca注册机构分享。出于保密需要，该考试成绩不会通过口头、传真或电子邮件传播。

**NAC考试合格成绩有效期**

应试者最近的考试成绩将长期有效，不会失效。如果应试者参加NAC考试次数超过1次，那么，只有其最近的考试成绩才会保持长期有效。  

**重考**

自2011年起，每年只有一次机会参加NAC考试，且每个人最多只能参加3次NAC考试。此外，自2015年起，凡是已经通过NAC考试的应试者（根据最近考试成绩显示）都将不能再参加该考试。  

**请求重新评分**

只有没有通过考试的应试者才可以请求重新评分，考试合格的应试者不可以请求重新评分。 **注意：**考试成绩公布之前会经过多次核查。如果应试者希望对自己的考试表现进行重新评分，必须： 

- 在考试成绩公布之后一个月内，通过个人账户递交请求，该请求必须包含请求重新评分的原因、应试者的姓名、MCC应试者编码、地址以及手机号码。  
- 递交书面请求时，必须使用信用卡（维萨信用卡或万事达信用卡）支付一定费用。经过重新评分之后，无论考试成绩还是考试状态发生变化，该费用都将会全部退还。

重新评分包括以下步骤：  

- 鉴定所有考试环节，包括复审所有考试文件，例如事件报告和医师评论。
- 验证所有计算机扫描的答题纸的异常现象，包括破损的答题纸、偏离的笔画、墨痕等等。  
- 根据医师完成的答题纸验证原始计算机数据。
- 根据考试结果信中的分数验证计算机存储的分数。

### 与实习项目相关的信息 ###

NAC考试对即将进入加拿大实习计划的国际医学毕业生进行评估。这是一个泛加拿大标准考试，为实习计划负责人提供一些客观信息，这些信息将反映申请加拿大研究生培训的国际医学毕业生的技能、态度和知识水平。  

NAC考试内容由NAC考试委员会负责制定。NAC考试委员会由来自加拿大全国各地的医师组成，这些医师都拥有多个医学领域的专业技术。

**考试背景与考试目的**

在NAC考试成立之前，许多省份都曾组织并实施单独临床考试对国际医学毕业生进行评估。之所以组织NAC考试，既是为了避免不同省份之间的国际医学毕业生评估项目出现重复现象，也是为了为加拿大全国实习计划负责人提供标准的考试成绩。考试结果将会为实习计划负责人提供一个综合评价，涉及国际医学毕业生的技能、态度、知识以及进入研究生培训项目达到加拿大医学毕业生水平的意愿。为了全面了解申请者的技能，可以同时参考该信息和其他信息，例如，实习申请信或者MCCEE考试结果。  

**考试范围与考试形式**

NAC考试是一次临床评价，共包含12个不同的临床检查点，每个检查点考试时间11分钟，每个检查点都有一个标准化病例和一位监考医师。  

尽管该考试总时间是大约两个半小时，但是由于考试管理需要应试者可能会在考试现场停留更长的时间。  

有关考试形式更多信息，请访问OSCE页面。 

**评估与评分**

考试成绩合格/不合格主要依据是应试者的考试分数是否等于或高于NAC考试合格分数。而这个标准是基于与加拿大医学院校毕业生考试表现的比较。NAC考试还会收集来自监考医师对应试者在道德和专业方面的能力的观察结果信息。  

**OSCE分数组成**

监考医师将对应试者的9项能力进行评估，这些能力包括：    
- 病史理解	
- 沟通技巧	
- 数据解读
- 身体检查	
- 语言流畅性	
- 调查
- 组织技巧	
- 诊断	
- 治疗与管理

应试者在每个检查点的分数是在该检查点各个能力评分的平均分。应试者的整个OSCE分数是所有检查点分数的平均分。  

最后考试结果评定阶段，NAC考试委员会还会考虑监考医师对应试者在道德和专业方面的能力的观察结果。

**考试内容的制定**

NAC考试内容由NAC考试委员会负责制定。NAC考试委员会由来自加拿大全国各地的医师组成，这些医师都拥有多个医学领域的专业技术。NAC考试委员会定期制定和审查考试内容，并依据加拿大医学院校毕业生的预期表现制定考试标准。  

**考试地点**

NAC考试目前通过省级IMG评估项目来举行，涉及的省份包括艾伯塔、不列颠哥伦比亚、安大略、曼尼托巴、新斯科舍和魁北克。

> ### Exam preparation resources ###
> 
> The National Assessment Collaboration (NAC) examination assesses the competence of international medical graduate candidates; specifically, the knowledge, skills and attitudes essential for entrance into postgraduate training in Canada. The following resources will aid candidates in preparing for the NAC examination.
> 
> **Examination day**
> 
> The duration of the examination itself is approximately three hours. However, candidates should anticipate six and a half to seven hours for the administration of the exam. For security reasons, candidates in certain cities may be required to arrive at a designated time prior to the examination and remain on site until a designated time following the examination. Specific instructions will be provided with the registration package prior to the examination date.
> 
> All candidates are required to function in a simulated clinical situation and must bring with them a plain white lab coat, a stethoscope and a reflex hammer. For a complete overview of the NAC examination regulations, candidates are encouraged to review the guidelines to follow on the day of the examination.
> 
> 
> **Medical Council of Canada (MCC) reference documents**
> 
> 
> NAC examination candidates are encouraged to review common mistakes made on objective structured clinical examination stations.
> 
> **Objectives for the Qualifying Examination**
> 
> 
> Using the Objectives for the Qualifying Examination as a study guide may be helpful for candidates taking the NAC examination. The Objectives serve as the basis for the Medical Council of Canada Evaluating Examination (MCCEE) and the Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination (MCCQE) Part I and Part II. These Objectives also serve as a general overview of possible test material that may appear on the NAC examination. Note that the Objectives are organized in terms of clinical presentations.
> 
> **Transition to DSM-5**
> 
> In May 2013 the American Psychiatric Association published the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).
> 
> Over 2014 and 2015, the MCCEE computer-based questions will be updated to include the new DSM-5 language. These updated questions will still include the DSM-IV-TR language, which will be featured in brackets after the DSM-5 terminology.
> 
> Candidates answering questions asked by the physician examiner can use either DSM-5 or DSM-IV-TR language where appropriate.
> 
> For more information, please visit Medical Council of Canada transition to DSM-5.
> 
> **Reference books**
> 
> 
> Prior to the examination, individuals who are unfamiliar with disease management practices in North America may wish to consult Therapeutic Choices edited by Jean Gray, published by the Canadian Pharmacists Association, as a source of general information.
> 
> **General IMG information** 
> 
> IMGs can also visit our Overview of the process of obtaining a licence to practise medicine for IMGs page for general information on beginning the process of obtaining a licence to practise medicine in Canada.

> 以下内容来源：http://mcc.ca/examinations/nac-overview/scoring/
> 
> ### Scoring ###
> 
> **Overview**
> 
> Objectivity on the NAC examination is achieved through the use of standardized guidelines for the administration, the training of physician examiners and standardized patients, and the use of predetermined scoring instruments. The OSCE component is evaluated by physician examiners based on the candidate’s performance at each station.
> 
> To pass the National Assessment Collaboration exam, a candidate must achieve an overall score that is set at the standard of a graduating student from a Canadian medical school. In awarding the final result on the examination, the NAC Examination Committee also considers any physician examiner observations on the candidate’s ability to demonstrate the appropriate ethical and professional behaviour.
> 
> **How are OSCE stations scored on the NAC exam?**
> 
> Physician examiners observe candidates interacting with standardized patients and provide ratings on up to nine competencies relevant to the presenting problem and clinical task. These competencies are history taking, physical examination, organization skills, communication skills, language fluency, diagnosis, data interpretation, investigations, therapeutics and management. The OSCE station score is the average of a physician examiner’s competency ratings. A candidate’s score on the OSCE is the average of the station scores.
> 
> **How are NAC scores reported?**
> 
> 
> NAC exam scores are reported on a scale with a distribution ranging from 0 to 100. The pass score is based on a performance equivalent to a graduating student from a Canadian medical school. A candidate’s performance is judged in relation to the exam pass score and not judged on how well other individuals have performed.
> 
> In addition to the total score, candidates are also provided with supplemental feedback on their exam performance. This report consists of a graphical display of the candidate’s performance on the competencies assessed.
> 
> Since competency scores are based on few observations, they do not have the same precision as the total score.
> 
> **New in 2015 – Changes to the supplemental feedback report**
> 
> Candidates from previous sessions may recall that their report contained a table with stations listed from high performance to low performance. As of 2015, the MCC has removed this table from the supplemental feedback report as the information it contained, while correct, could be misinterpreted and/or misleading.
> 
> The table provided a rank order of stations, but candidate performance in some cases was equal, close to equal, or not equidistant across all stations. As a result of this change, in 2015 the report will be one page instead of two.
> 
> 
> 以下内容来源： http://mcc.ca/examinations/nac-overview/results/
> 
> ### Results ###
> 
> **Release of results**
> 
> 
> Important: Results will be available in your physiciansapply.ca account, 6 to 8 weeks after the date of your exam. Therefore, candidates who took the exam on Sept. 12 or Sept. 13 might receive results prior to candidates taking the examination on Sept. 19 or Sept. 20.
> 
> Examination results are confirmed by the National Assessment Collaboration (NAC) Examination Committee and are released by the Medical Council of Canada (MCC) through physiciansapply.ca six to eight weeks after the examination date. The MCC also provides supplemental feedback on candidates’ examination performance through their physiciansapply.ca account. Candidates will be able to share their results with the Canadian Resident Matching Service (CaRMS) and other organizations registered with physiciansapply.ca. For reasons of confidentiality, results cannot be given verbally, by fax or by email.
> 
> **Validity period of a pass result on the NAC examination**
> 
> A candidate’s most recent result remains valid indefinitely (no longer expires). If a candidate takes the NAC examination more than once, the most recent result will be the only valid result.
> 
> **Retaking the examination**
> 
> 
> The NAC examination can be attempted once per calendar year and can be taken a maximum of three times (effective from 2011). Eligible candidates who have a pass standing on the NAC examination (most recent result) will not be eligible to retake the exam (effective from 2015).
> 
> **Rescore requests**
> 
> Only candidates who have failed the NAC examination can request a rescoring of their examination; candidates with a pass result are not eligible for the rescoring service. Please note that scores are verified several times before results are released. Candidates who wish to have their examination rescored must:
> 
> - Submit a message through your account within one month of the results release date indicated on the Statement of Results. The request should include an explanation for the rescore request, the candidate’s name, MCC candidate code, address and phone number.
> - Accompany the written request with payment of the applicable fee by credit card (Visa or MasterCard). Fees are refunded if a rescore procedure leads to a score or status change.
> 
> A rescore includes the following steps:
> 
> - Authentication of all parts of your examination, including a complete file review (incident reports and physician comments)
> - Verification of the computer-scanned answer sheets for anomalies (torn sheets, stray marks, ink marks, etc.).
> - Verification of raw computer data against physician-completed answer sheets.
> - Verification of the computer file scores against those reported in the result letter
> 
> A rescore does NOT include a re-evaluation of the candidate’s performance by additional examiners.
> 
> Rescores are processed within four to six weeks from the date they are received. Please note that the new score could be higher, lower or the same as the original score received.
> 
> 以下内容来源：http://mcc.ca/examinations/nac-overview/information-residency-program-directors/
> 
> ### Information for residency program directors ###
> 
> 
> The National Assessment Collaboration (NAC) examination assesses the readiness of an international medical graduate (IMG) for entrance into a Canadian residency program. It is a pan-Canadian, standardized examination that provides residency program directors with objective information on the skills, attitudes and knowledge level of IMGs applying for postgraduate training in Canada.
> 
> It is developed by the NAC Examination Committee, a group of physicians and medical educators from across the country with expertise in assessment and clinical content.
> 
> **Background and rationale**
> 
> Prior to the creation of the NAC examination, a number of provinces developed and delivered individual clinical examinations to assess IMGs. The NAC examination was developed to reduce duplication between provincial IMG assessment programs and offer standardized results to Canadian residency program directors across the country. The exam results provide residency program directors with a comprehensive assessment of an IMG’s skills, attitudes, knowledge and readiness at the level of a recent Canadian medical graduate for entry into postgraduate training. This information can be used in concert with other information – such as a residency application letter or results from the Medical Council of Canada Evaluating Examination (MCCEE) – to obtain a comprehensive view of an applicant’s skill set.
> 
> **Scope  and format**
> 
> The NAC examination is a clinical evaluation that consists of up to 12 different 11-minute clinical stations, each with a standardized patient and a physician examiner.
> 
> In total, the duration of the exam is approximately 2.5 hours. However, the candidate may be on site for a longer period of time for administrative reasons.
> 
> Visit our OSCE station page for more detailed information on the format of the NAC examination.
> 
> **Evaluation and scoring**
> 
> The pass/fail result is based on whether a candidates’ examination score is equal or higher than the pass score established for the NAC examination. The standard is based on the level of performance compared to a graduate from a Canadian medical school. The NAC examination also collects information from physician examiners on the candidate’s ability to demonstrate ethical and professional behaviour.
> 
> **OSCE component scoring**
> 
> Candidates are rated by physician examiners on up to nine different competencies per station. These competencies include:
> 
> 
> - History taking	
> - Communication skills	
> - Data interpretation
> - Physical examination	
> - Language fluency	
> - Investigations
> - Organizational skills	
> - Diagnosis	
> - Therapeutics and Management
> 
> A candidate’s score for each station is the average of all competency ratings measured on the station. A candidate’s score for the entire OSCE is the average of the station scores.
> 
> In awarding the final result on the examination, consideration is given to any observations made by the physician examiner at each of the stations regarding the candidate’s ability to demonstrate the ethical and professional behaviour needed to enter postgraduate training.
> 
> More detailed information on NAC examination scoring can be found on the Scoring page.
> 
> **Content development**
> 
> Content for the NAC examination is developed by the NAC Examination Committee – a group of physicians from across the country with expertise in multiple medical disciplines. The Examination Committee meets on a regular basis to develop and review content and set standards based on the expected performance of a graduate from a Canadian medical school.
> 
> Learn more about the NAC Examination Committee.
> 
> **Testing locations**
> 
> The NAC examination is currently delivered through provincial IMG assessment programs in Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Quebec.

### 考试预约 - 飞出国 ###

**选择考试中心**

- 在线报考NAC考试时，你可以按照优先次序选择3个考试中心。
- 如果你只选择一个考试中心，那么，你被安排到一个具体考试中心的可能性不会更大。
- MCC会尽力满足你优先选择的考试中心，但是，不能保证肯定能为你安排你选择的考试中心。  
 
**确认考试中心**

- MCC工作人员会在二月底之前为所有合格的应试者安排好考试中心，之后，应试者会收到可以在线确认自己的考试中心安排的消息。  
- MCC官网也会公布相关通知。
- 大约两周之后，所有应试者都会收到相关通知，可以通过个人账号查看考试入场卡包，其中还包括查看并打印考试入场卡包的具体操作。  

**在线预约考试日期**

MCC不能保证你能把考试预约到考试期间的具体某一天。

- 你必须在MCCQE第一部分考试规定的预约时间内通过个人账户预约个人考试日期。  
- 每个考试中心在计算机实验室大小以及可以提供考试的天数方面都有其局限性。
- 即使指定的考试中心只开放一天，你也必须在线预约个人考试日期，因为只有这样你才可以获得个人身份编码（PIN)。考试当天你必须使用PIN才可以登陆电脑，并开始考试。  
- 如果在MCCQE第一部分考试规定的预约时间内，你没有预约个人考试日期，MCC工作人员将人工操作为你做相关安排。 

**预约申请**

- 如果出现了任何重大冲突，例如：还有其他考试，国外旅行限制等等，应试者必须在MCCQE第一部分考试规定的预约时间之前提出必须错过某个具体考试日期的请求。  
- 你不可以变更考试期次。也就是说，当你的考试中心、考试日期以及考试时间都是在春季考试时，如果你打算推迟此次考试到下次秋季考试甚至更靠后的考试，那么，你必须撤销此次报考申请（必须支付一定考试管理费用），然后重新报考该考试。  
- 考试中心以及其所适用的考试日期一经确认，你必须马上告知类似重大冲突，同时递交相关辅助文件并支付提前预约相关费用。  

**考试中心确定之后变更考试日期**

考试中心确定之后，可以申请变更考试中心，但是必须在本期考试允许的范围内，且书面申请必须在2016年3月22日星期二之前递交MCC，此外，所申请的考试中心必须还有考试座位。  

变更申请通过之后，你必须支付一定考试中心变更费用。    

递交考试变更申请时，你必须了解的一点是，如果MCCQE第一部分考试预约时间已经开始或者已经结束，那么，申请的考试中心可以选择的考试日期很可能非常有限。  

**预约考试日期之后变更考试日期**

在2016年3月22日星期二之前递交书面申请且在所申请日期当天有可用考试座位，只有在这样的情况下，才可以申请变更考试日期。  

变更申请通过之后，你必须支付一定考试日期变更费用。  

如果考试日期变更申请要求同时变更考试中心，前提是你本人同意变更考试中心，那么，你只需要支付相关考试中心变更费用。

### 语言质量保证 ###

MCC考试采用英语和法语两种官方语言，但是，无论是英语考试还是法语考试，都会遵循综合性质量保证流程，以确保高质量的考试内容。  

**考试内容的开发**

MCC考试内容由其考试委员会负责开发，该考试委员会成员都是加拿大医生，且都是自己领域内的专家。该考试委员会还代表英语和法语这两种官方语言群。  

**翻译过程**

考试委员会最初命制的考试题采用英语的形式，之后MCC会让精通医学术语翻译的专业翻译人员翻译这些考题。翻译完成之后，将根据要求对其内容进行核查，以确保考试质量：  

1. MCC内部编辑负责对比英语考题和法语翻译。  
2. 考试委员会中讲法语的成员负责另一种对比审查，其中包括大声朗读考试内容。  
3. 来自法国医学院会讲法语的专业医生负责另一轮的对比阅读。在该阶段，每个法语考题由2到3个会讲法语的医生负责审查。  

**应试者反馈**

MCC鼓励参加考试的应试者对可能有歧义或迷惑性的考试内容积极地进行反馈。应试者也可以在每个考题的**备注**处写上自己的意见。委员会在评分之前会审查应试者对考试内容的质量的反馈和评论。  

**考题分析**

新编内容无论是英语的还是法语的都先会试用然后才会用作考试内容。试用考题不会计入应试者的分数。考试之后，MCC会分析应试者对这些试用考题的反映。如果考题达不到预期的效果，考试委员会会再次审查修订，然后继续试用，直到达到预期效果。  

尚未达到预期效果的考题，在评分之前委员会会给这些考题贴上审查的标记。如果确认该考题中存在的错误或缺陷影响了考生考试表现，那么该考题将不计入应试者的考试分数。

### 考试准备资源 ###

**自我管理的资格考试第一部分**

MCC提供自我管理资格考试第一部分，这是一种包含96道多项选择题的在线模拟考试，旨在让应试者检验其水平，为MCCQE第一部分考试做准备。虽然SAE-QEI无法涵盖MCCQE第一部分所有考试内容，也不能取代MCCQE第一部分考试，但是，它提供的考题形式和考题风格却很可能在MCCQE第一部分中出现，所以对考试有一定的帮助。此外，所有的SAE-QEI的考试难度相当。应试者完成该考试后马上就会收到反馈的电子邮件，得知自己回答正确的题目以及自己的考试表现与其他应试者的考试表现之间的对比。  

**注意：**和MCCQE第一部分考试不同的是，SAE-QEI不包括临床决策部分，目前，只能用于准备MCCQE第一部分的多项选择部分。  

**考试演示**

MCC提供了MCCQE第一部分考试的多项选择题部分和临床决策部分的演示版。  

MCCQE第一部分在线演示提供计算机考试操作演示。应试者在真正参加考试之前可以熟悉一下计算机考试环境以及其特点。MCCQE第一部分在线演示共包括MCQ部分28道选择题和CDM6个案例。在线演示将提供正确答案但是不会对用户提交的答案进行评分。演示最后将会出现**考题回顾**，这些也将在真正考试中出现。  

[观看MCCQE第一部分MCQ演示](https://apps.mcc.ca/qe1_demo/StartPage.aspx?e=1)

[观看MCCQE第一部分CDM演示](https://apps.mcc.ca/qe1_demo/StartPage.aspx?e=2)

**注意：**演示中有效剩余时间在MCCQE第一部分考试中并不适用。考试过程中现场工作人员会告知应试者考试剩余时间。  

**教学影片**

MCC为MCQ部分和CDM部分制作了教学影片，该影片有法语版和英语版两个版本。应试者最好在考试之前观看这些影片，熟悉一下考试界面和操作功能。每一个教学影片时长大约20分钟。考试当天将不会有时间观看这些影片。 

**资格考试目标**

参加MCCQE第一部分考试的应试者可以把**资格考试目标**作为学习指南。**注意**：其中涉及的目标主要是有关临床表现！每个临床表现都会有一些学习目标，而这些学习目标是所有参加MCC考试的应试者都必须准确把握的。  

应试者在备考时应该系统地学习每一个临床表现，并仔细阅读相关目标。当应试者感觉自己在某个特定的目标方面的知识或技能比较薄弱时，他们就会意识到自己应该强化这一方面的学习，甚至需要参考一些医学参考书/课本。MCC考试委员会成员在命制考试题时所依据的就是该资源中的临床表现和学习目标。 

**DSM-5过渡**

2013年5月美国精神病科协会发布了精神障碍诊断和统计手册的第五个版本（DSM-5)。  

从2014年到2015年，以计算机为基础的MCCEE考题将更新使用DSM-5最新语言，这些更新的考题将继续使用DSM-IV-TR语言，不同的一点是，其前面会附上DSM-5术语。 

2014年春季的MCCEE考试将是第一次包含更新考题的MCCQE考试。至于MCCQE第一部分考试临床决策填空题，无论应试者使用DSM-5语言还是使用DSM-IV-TR语言，都必须填写正确答案才可以得满分。  

**参考书目**

MCC编纂了一系列参考书目，这些书将有助于应试者准备考试。  

**应试者说明**

应试者最好仔细阅读考试说明:

[多项选择题（MCQ)版块](http://mcc.ca/wp-content/uploads/Exams-MCQ-candidate-instructions.pdf)

[临床决策（CDM)版块](http://mcc.ca/examinations/mccqe-part-i/clinical-decision-making/candidate-instructions/)

### 评分 ###

**概述**
MCCQE第一部分考试采用单独评分方式，与MCCQE第二部分考试毫无关联。但是，应试者必须同时通过MCCQE第一部分考试和第二部分考试，才会获得LMCC医生执照。  

MCCQE第一部分考试和所有MCC考试一样都是标准参照考试。这就意味着只要应试者达到或超过考试标准就能通过考试，而不会受到其他应试者表现的影响。 


**MCCQE第一部分考试如何计算总分数？如何计算各项分数?**
总分会结合多项选择题（MCQ)	和临床决策问题（CDM)进行计算。多项选择题回答正确得一分，回答错误零分。而临床决策问题每个问题最多得一分。对于一些问题例如其选项共包含四个正确选项，应试者可能会得部分分数，0.25分，0.5分，0.75分或者1分。MCCQE第一部分考试总分变化范围从50分到950分。各学科分数只包含多项选择题分数，而CDM分数会包含临床决策问题分数。  

**如何确定合格分数**

加拿大医务委员会每3到5年就会举行一次标准设定练习，以确保考试标准以及合格分数的合理性。标准设定这个流程是用来确定合格的考试表现水平并制定考试合格分数。  

为了这个最终目的，加拿大医务委员会咨询了17位来自全国各地、可以代表所有医学院的医生的意见，因为他们不仅各有所长，而且都具有多年监督医学生和住院医师的经验，之后才进行了严格的标准设定练习。书签标定法曾经而且目前仍被世界上许多大型考试项目所运用。标准设定练习之后，中央考试委员会提出实行这种全新的合格分数，该建议接受审查并获得了通过。中央考试委员会的成员是来自全国各地的医生和医学教育者。该委员会每年都会吸收新成员。该委员会负责保证考试质量并为所以应试者评定最终考试结果。  

所有2015年春季MCCQE第一部分考试的应试者的考试成绩考虑在内之后，才确立了平均分是500、标准偏差是100的新范围。2015年春季考试以及随后的考试都将根据这个新范围记录考试成绩，这样就可以对参加2015年秋季之后考试的应试者的考试表现进行比较。例如，如果将来的某次考试平均分是510分，那么此次考试应试者的表现比平均分是500分的2015年春季那次考试应试者的表现好。在该新范围下，由常设考试小组建议并获得通过的合格分数是427分，该合格分数将会在将来的MCCQE第一部分考试中一直适用。  

2015年之前，MCCQE第一部分考试在原来50分到950分的分数基础上合格分数是390分，而2015年之后，在原来分数基础上合格分数是440分。  

**如何判断合格还是不合格?**

应试者最终考试结果取决于其总分与考试合格分数之间的差异。总分大于等于合格分数，考试结果就是合格；总分小于合格分数，考试结果就是不合格。而应试者的考试表现根据考试合格分数判断，并不是通过其他应试者的表现判断。

**考试成绩单和补充性反馈报告都包含什么内容?**

SOR包含应试者的最终考试结果、考试总分以及合格分数。其他信息包括各科和CDM各项分数以及比较信息都由SFR提供。有关SFR解读方法见帮助文件！SOR和SFR可以通过physiciansapply.ca account查看。 

以下内容来源：http://mcc.ca/examinations/mccqe-part-i/result/

### 考试结果 ###

**考试结果公布**

MCC中央考试委员会确认考试结果之后，应试者会收到一封电子邮件，通知其可以通过physiciansapply.ca个人账户查看自己合格/不合格考试结果。之后，应试者的physiciansapply.ca个人账户很快就会收到一份考试成绩单和一份补充性反馈报告。   

为了避免发生任何错误或欺诈行为，同时出于保密性的需要，考试结果将不会通过电话、传真或电子邮件公布。   

当应试者申请的组织要求其提供考试成绩单和补充性反馈报告的认证复件时，应试者可以申请MCC发送认证复件，但是，必须支付一定的服务费。  

**考试结果通知方式**

MCC通过physiciansapply.ca向应试者发送一份考试成绩单，该声明包含应试者最终考试结果、总分以及合格分数。除此之外，MCC还会通过physiciansapply.ca对应试者的考试表现进行补充性反馈。MCC还会为MCCQE第一部分考试应试者提供一个之前签发的考试成绩单和补充性反馈报告范例。  

当应试者申请的机构要求其提供一份考试成绩单或补充性反馈报告的认证复件，应试者可以向MCC申请发送认证复件。但是，该服务需要支付一定管理费用。

**考试失败**

尽管MCC不限制MCCQE第一部分考试应试者参加考试的次数，但是，通过考试的应试者不可以再次报考以期刷新考试成绩。

**请求重新评分**

只有没有通过MCCQE第一部分考试的应试者才可以请求重新评分；凡是通过该考试的应试者都不可以申请重新评分。准备参加春季考试的应试者必须在9月1日之前递交重新评分请求；准备参加秋季考试的应试者必须在3月1日之前递交重新评分请求。应试者必须递交书面请求，并使用信用卡支付一定的费用。  

应试者有两种重新评分选择：  

1. [由MCC重新评分](http://mcc.ca/examinations/rescoring-by-mcc/)
1. [在MCC办公处应试者在场时进行重新评分Rescoring with the candidate present at the MCC’s office](http://mcc.ca/examinations/rescoring-with-candidate-present/)

考试结束之后，最终考试结果至少经过3次核查才会发送给应试者。边缘分数，即靠近及格分数线的分数，接受的核查次数更多。鉴于MCC会额外审查边缘分数，所以重新评分之后也不可能改变最后的考试分数，只可能产生三种结果：考试分数不变；考试分数有所改变但是考试结果仍然不合格；考试分数有所改变，考试结果由不合格变成合格。重新评分之后，无论是考试分数发生了改变还是考试结果发生了改变，MCC都会通过应试者physiciansapply.ca个人账户重新签发考试结果声明和补充性反馈报告。

**投诉**

当MCCQE第一部分考试的应试者被取消考试资格，包括以任何形式被拒绝报考将来的考试，或者认为考试结果有失公允时，可以向投诉委员会提出投诉。应试者不可以对考试内容提出任何投诉。  

如果你打算提出投诉，必须在收到评估考试合作委员会决定之后45天之内书面通知执行董事。

> 
> **Selecting a centre**
> 
> - During the online application process, you must select up to three examination centres, in order of preference
> - The likelihood of being assigned to a particular centre does not improve if you choose only one centre
> - The Medical Council of Canada (MCC) makes every effort to provide you with a space at one of your requested centres; however, it cannot guarantee your assignment to one of these centres
> 
> **Confirmation of centre assignment**
> 
> - Once MCC staff has assigned centres for all accepted candidates, by the end of February, candidates will be sent a communication to confirm their centre assignment information online
> - A notice will also be posted on the MCC website
> - Approximately two weeks following the designated scheduling period, a message will be sent to all candidates informing them that their Entrance card package is now available through their account; instructions on how to view and print the entrance card package will also be provided in this message
> 
> 
> **Scheduling the examination date online**
> 
> The MCC cannot guarantee that you will be able to schedule your examination on a specific day within the examination period.
> 
> - You will be required to schedule your examination date through your account during the designated MCCQE Part I scheduling period
> - Each centre has restrictions based on the size of its computer lab and the number of days it can provide the examination
> - Even if your assigned centre is only running for one day, you must schedule your examination date online in order to obtain your Personal Identification Number (PIN), which is required to log onto the computer on examination day
> - If you do not schedule your examination date during the designated MCCQE Part I Scheduling period, an MCC staff member will manually assign you to one of the remaining available days at your assigned centre
> 
> **Request for scheduling**
> 
> - In the event of a significant conflict (for example, another examination, overseas travel restrictions, etc.), a candidate may request consideration, in advance of the designated MCCQE Part I scheduling period, to not be scheduled on a specific day
> - You cannot ‘change’ examination sessions. If you are assigned a centre, date and time to take the examination in the spring session, and wish to delay taking the examination until the following fall session or beyond, you will need to withdraw your application (the withdrawal administration fee will apply), and reapply when you wish to take the examination
> - Notice of such a conflict, with supporting documentation and payment of the pre-scheduling fee, should be submitted once confirmation of centre assignment is obtained and the dates available at each of the centres are known
> 
> **Examination date changes after centre assignmet**
> 
> Deadlines, fees, procedure for centre change requests:
> 
> After you have been assigned to a centre, a request for a centre change (within the session you applied for) will be considered, provided that a written request is submitted to the MCC by Tuesday, March 22, 2016 and space is available at the requested centre
> A centre change fee will apply if the requested change can be accommodated
> When submitting a centre change request, you should keep in mind that if the MCCQE Part I scheduling period has already begun or has ended, the dates available at the requested centre will likely be very limited
> 
> **Examination date changes after the date has been scheduled**
> 
> Deadlines, fees, procedure for date change requests:
> 
> A request for a date change will be considered provided that a written request is submitted to the MCC no later than Tuesday, March 22, 2016 and space is available on the requested date
> A date change fee will apply if the requested change can be accommodated
> If a centre change is required to accommodate the requested date change (and only if you approve this change), only the centre change fee will apply

> ### Language quality assurance ###
> 
> The Medical Council of Canada (MCC) produces examination content in both official languages (English/French). It follows a comprehensive quality assurance process to ensure that examination content, whether in English or French, is of the highest quality.
> 
> **Content development**
> 
> MCC examination content is developed by the MCC’s test committees, made up of physicians from across Canada who are experts in their fields. The test committees include representation from both official language groups (English and French).
> 
> **Translation process**
> 
> Examination questions are initially created in English by the test committees. The MCC then sends the questions to professional translators who have medical terminology translation expertise. Once the translation is complete, the following quality assurance steps are taken and content revisions made as required:
> 
> 1. MCC in-house editors perform multiple comparative reads (comparing English questions to French translations).
> 1. A Francophone test committee member performs another set of comparative reviews, which includes reading the content out loud.
> 1. Francophone specialist physicians from French faculties of medicine participate in another round of comparative readings. Each French examination question is reviewed by two to three Francophone physicians during these sessions.
> 
> **Candidate input**
> 
> The MCC encourages candidates taking the examination to report any content that may be ambiguous or confusing. Candidates can also make comments in the “notes” section attached to each exam question. All candidate reports and comments about the quality of the content are reviewed by the committee prior to scoring the examination.
> 
> **Question analysis**
> 
> New content, whether in English or in French, is piloted before it is used as active content on the examination. Pilot questions do not count toward the candidate’s score. The MCC analyzes candidates’ response patterns after the examination. Any question that does not perform as expected is returned to the committee for review and revision, and is later re-piloted.
> 
> Should an active question not meet expected performance requirements, it is also flagged for review by the committee prior to scoring the examination. If it is determined that an error or flaw in the question could have affected performance, it will not count toward the candidates’ score.

> **Self-Administered Qualifying Examination Part I**
> 
> The Medical Council of Canada (MCC) offers the Self Administered Qualifying Examination Part I (SAE – QEI), an online, 96 multiple-choice question practice examination intended for individuals wishing to test their level of preparedness for the Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination Part I (MCCQE Part I). Multiple forms are available at any given time. The Self Administered Qualifying Examination Part I does not cover all material in the MCCQE Part I and is not meant to take the place of the MCCQE Part I. However, it does provide a sample of the type and style of questions that may be found in the MCCQE Part I and can serve as a study aid. All Self Administered Qualifying Examinations for Part I (QEI 1, QEI 2, QEI 3) are all at the same level of difficulty (e.g., QEI 3 is not more difficult than QEI 1 or QEI 2). Following completion, feedback is immediately e-mailed to participants on the number of correctly answered questions as well as a comparison of their performance to those of other MCCQE Part I participants.
> 
> Please note that unlike the MCCQE Part I examination, the SAE – QEI does not contain a clinical decision-making component. At present, the SAE – QEI can only be used to prepare for the multiple-choice component of the MCCQE Part I.
> 
> **Examination demo**
> 
> 
> The MCC is pleased to offer demonstration versions of the multiple-choice question (MCQ) component and the clinical decision-making (CDM) component of the MCCQE Part I.
> 
> The MCCQE Part I Online Demo provides a demonstration of how the computer-based examination operates. Candidates will be able to familiarize themselves with the computer-testing environment and learn about each feature before using it in the actual examination. The MCCQE Part I Online Demo includes 28 questions in the MCQ section and six cases in the CDM. The correct answers are provided and answers that the user submits will not be scored. The last screen of the demo shows the Item Reviewing feature that replicates what will be seen on the actual examination.

> 
> **Instructional video**
> 
> The MCC has created instructional videos for both the MCQ component and the CDM component. They are offered in French and English. Candidates are strongly encouraged to view these videos prior to the examination to become familiar with the examination interface and functionality. Each instructional video clip lasts approximately 20 minutes. There will be no time available to view these videos on examination day.
> 
> **Objectives for the Qualifying Examination**
> 
> Using the Objectives for the Qualifying Examination as a study guide may be helpful for candidates taking the MCCQE Part I. Note that the Objectives are organized in terms of clinical presentations. Under each clinical presentation is a set of learning objectives that are exactly what candidates have to know for any of the MCC examinations.
> 
> When studying for an examination, candidates should systematically go through each clinical presentation and carefully read the related objectives. If candidates feel that their knowledge or skills related to a given objective is weak, then they know that this objective needs further study and will require them to consult a medical reference/textbook. The MCC test committee members use the clinical presentations and learning objectives listed in this resource when creating test questions.
> 
> 
> **Transition to DSM-5**
> 
> In May 2013 the American Psychiatric Association published the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).
> 
> Over 2014 and 2015, the MCCEE computer-based questions will be updated to include the new DSM-5 language. These updated questions will still include the DSM-IV-TR language, which will be featured in brackets after the DSM-5 terminology.
> 
> The first MCCQE Part I administration to include updated questions will be the spring 2014 session. For answers to MCCQE Part I clinical decision-making write-in questions, candidates will continue to receive full marks for correct answers regardless of whether they use DSM-5 or DSM-IV-TR language.

> ### Scoring ###
> 
> **Overview**
> 
> The Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination (MCCQE) Part I is scored independently of the MCCQE Part II. To be awarded the Licentiate of the Medical Council of Canada (LMCC), a candidate must pass both the MCCQE Part I and Part II.
> 
> The MCCQE Part I, like all Medical Council of Canada (MCC) exams is a criterion-referenced exam. This means that candidates who meet or exceed the standard will pass the exam regardless of how well other candidates perform on it.
> 
> **How are total scores and sub-scores calculated on the MCCQE Part I?**
> 
> The total score is calculated by combining multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and clinical decision-making questions (CDMs). MCQs are scored 1 point for a correct answer and scored 0 for an incorrect answer. For CDMs, there is a maximum of 1 point per question. Some questions, such as a question whose answer includes four correct elements, allow candidates to receive partial marks (e.g., 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 or 1). The MCCQE Part I total score is reported on a scale that ranges from 50 to 950. Discipline sub-scores include scores from MCQs only and the CDM sub-score includes scores from CDMs.
> 
> **How is the pass score established?**
> 
> The Medical Council of Canada (MCC) conducts a standard setting exercise every three to five years to ensure that the standard and the pass score remain appropriate. Standard setting is a process used to define an acceptable level of performance and to establish a pass score.
> 
> To this end, the MCC completed a rigorous standard setting exercise based on expert judgments from a panel of 17 physicians across the country that represented faculties of medicine, different specialties, and years of experience supervising students and residents. The Bookmark Method was used and has been successfully employed (and defended) with a number of large-scale exam programs around the world. Following the standard setting exercise, the new pass score was brought forward to the Central Examination Committee (CEC), which reviewed and approved the recommendation. The CEC is represented by physicians and medical educators from across the country. The members of this Committee are appointed by our Council annually. The CEC is responsible for the quality of our examinations and awards final results to our candidates (e.g., pass, fail).
> 
> Using the spring 2015 results of all MCCQE Part I candidates, the new scale was established to have a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100. Candidates results from the spring 2015 and subsequent exam sessions will be reported on this new scale allowing us to compare candidate performance across sessions beginning with the spring 2015 session. For example, a mean score of 510 on a future session would indicate a stronger performance of that group than the spring 2015 group that had a mean of 500. On this new scale, the pass score that was recommended from the standing setting panel and approved by the CEC is 427. This pass score will remain in place for subsequent MCCQE Part I sessions.
> 
> Prior to 2015, the pass score for the MCCQE Part I was 390 on the old 50 to 950 scale. The new pass score (427) translates to 440 on this old scale.
> 
> **How is a pass/fail decision made?**
> 
> A candidate’s final result (e.g., pass, fail) is determined by his or her total score and where it falls in relation to the examination pass score. A total score equal to or greater than the pass score is a pass and a total score less than the pass score is a fail. The candidate’s performance is judged in relation to the examination pass score and not judged on how well other individuals perform.
> 
> **What will appear on the Statement of Results and Supplemental Feedback Report?**
> 
> The SOR includes the candidate’s final result and total score, as well as the pass score. Additional information about discipline and CDM sub-scores and comparative information is provided on the SFR. See the help file for additional information on how to interpret the SFR. Both the SOR and the SFR are made available through the candidate’s physiciansapply.ca account.

> 
> ### Results ###
> 
> **Release of results**
> 
> Examination results are confirmed by the MCC Central Examination Committee, which meets in June for the spring administration and in December for the fall administration. After result confirmation, candidates will receive an email notification stating that they can verify their pass/fail result through their physiciansapply.ca account. The Statement of Results and the supplemental feedback report will be posted in candidates’ physiciansapply.ca accounts shortly thereafter.
> 
> To prevent errors or fraud and for reasons of confidentiality, results cannot be given over the phone, by fax or by email.
> 
> Candidates applying to an organization that requires submission of certified copies of the Statement of Results or the supplemental feedback report can request that the MCC send certified copies. There is an administrative fee for this service.
> 
> **How results are communicated**
> 
> The Medical Council of Canada (MCC) issues candidates a Statement of Results through their physiciansapply.ca account. The Statement of Results includes the candidate’s final result and total score as well as the score that was required to pass the examination. The MCC also provides supplemental feedback on candidates’ examination performance through their physiciansapply.ca account. The MCC provides an example of a previously issued Statement of Results and the supplemental feedback report for the Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination Part I (MCCQE Part I).
> 
> **Fails**
> 
> The MCC does not limit the number of times a candidate may attempt the MCCQE Part I. However, candidates who have been awarded a pass result on the MCCQE Part I cannot retake the examination in an attempt to obtain a higher score.
> 
> **Rescore requests**
> 
> 
> Only candidates who have failed the MCCQE Part I can request a rescoring of their examination; candidates with a pass result are not eligible for the rescoring service. Rescore requests must be submitted by Sept. 1 for the spring exam, or by March 1 for the fall exam. Requests will be accepted upon receipt of a written request and a credit card payment of the applicable fee.
> 
> Candidates can choose between two rescoring options:
> 
> 1. [Rescoring by the MCC](http://mcc.ca/examinations/rescoring-by-mcc/)
> 1. [Rescoring with the candidate present at the MCC’s office](http://mcc.ca/examinations/rescoring-with-candidate-present/)
> 
> After the examination, all final results are verified at least three times before being sent to the candidates. Borderline results (i.e., those within a close range of the passing score) undergo increased review. Given the additional scrutiny that the MCC gives to borderline results, it is unlikely that rescoring the examination will produce a change in result. Three potential outcomes can occur as a result of the rescoring of the examination: no change in score, change in score but no change in the fail result, or change in score and change in fail to pass result. If the rescoring produces a change in score or a change in score and final result, the MCC will issue a new Statement of Results and supplemental feedback report to the candidate through his or her physiciansapply.ca account.
> 
> **Appeals**
> 
> Any MCCQE Part I candidate who has been denied standing, including any denial of entry to future examinations, or who considers that the results of an examination have been prejudiced by the conduct of the examination may appeal to the Appeals Committee. Candidates cannot seek to appeal the content of the examination.
> 
> Any candidate wishing to launch an appeal must notify the Executive Director in writing within 45 days of the decision of the Central Examination Committee. For more information on the appeal process for the MCCQE Part I, please review the MCC bylaws.

## MCCQE考试第二部分 ##

MCCQE第二部分考试主要对应试者的能力进行评估，具体说来就是具备相关的知识、技能和态度，这些对于获得加拿大医生执照尤为重要，只有具备这些知识、技能和态度应试者才可以进入独立临床实践。  


该考试设有一系列临床检查点，其中包括不计入应试者总分的试验检查点。每个检查点都会有一个简要书面说明介绍一个临床难题，然后应试者根据说明对标准化病人进行检查等一系列活动，例如采集病史、进行身体检查、评估并解决病人疾病。应试者可能会被要求回答一些关于病人的一些问题，解读X射线或其他检查结果，诊断疾病和/或写住院要求。  

考试中出现的临床难题涉及内科、小儿科、妇产科、预防医学与社区健康、精神科与外科以及与全科医学和卫生保健息息相关的其他相似学科。

自2016年起家庭医学开始采用此全新考试结构，因此MCCQE第二部分考试报名人数显著增加。2015年秋季MCCQE第二部分考试限制了报考名额。有些考生原本打算报考2015年秋季考试，但是当时报考名额已满，，这些考生可以选择登记预先注册2016年春季MCCQE第二部分考试。  

在预先注册名单的应试者将可以在2015年11月份预先注册期间报考该考试。普通注册会在预先注册关闭之后开放，将适用于所有已完成培训或者在PGY-2年及以上的医生。MCC希望能够通过预先注册和普通注册为所有符合条件的PGY-2+应试者（包括已完成培训的医生）提供足够的报考名额。

自今年起实行 - MCC变动了MCCQE第二部分考试合格标准。PGY-1应试者如果在2016年6月30日之前能够完成第一年的住院医生实习期，就可以报考2016年春季MCCQE第二部分考试。针对PGY-1应试者的注册时间将于2016年1月开放，报名人数将会非常有限。  

**申请2016年秋季MCCQE第二部分考试**

针对2016年春季MCCQE第二部分考试MCC会提供三个考试报名时间段： 

- 预先注册阶段 - 2015年11月16日起开放一周。
  - 该注册阶段只适用于在预先注册名单的应试者。  
  - 这些应试者原本打算报考2015年秋季考试，但是由于当时报考名额已满，没有完成报名流程，于是选择登记预先注册。
- 普通考试报名将于2015年11月23日起开放一周。  
- PGY-1 注册 – 据估计将于2016年1月4日起开放一周。 

- 有关考试中心安排，请访问**考试中心**页面。  
- MCCQE第二部分考试不采用双语的形式，每个考试中心采用英语或法语一种形式。  
- 应试者将会被安排在考试周的某两天参加两场考试。  

**MCCQE第二部分考试拟定考试日期**

### 考试人数 ###


**将如何限制报名人数?**

**注意:** 目前MCCQE第二部分考试报名渠道已经关闭。据估计2016年春季MCCQE第二部分考试报名将于2015年11月开放。  

MCC必须确保每次考试中都有大量第一次参加考试的加拿大毕业生，以保证考试分数的可靠性、有效性和可比性。  

只有每次考试中有大量第一次参加考试的加拿大毕业生，才能保证应试者不会由于OSCE检查点难度太大或太小而处于劣势或优势，这样不仅可以确定考试难度，而且也可以调整考试分数。  

其他应试者同样受报考名额限制。这样就可以确保应试者的多样性，监考医生也可以根据普遍的标准作出更好的评估。  

MCC在2015年秋季MCCQE第二部分考试中保留了一定的考试座位，专门针对将通过2015年春季第一部分考试或者将不能通过2015年春季MCCQE第二部分考试的应试者。  

第一次参加考试的加拿大毕业生；重复参加考试的国际医学毕业生、美国毕业生和加拿大毕业生；收到春季考试成绩单的应试者，这三个群体进一步划分为英语考试和法语考试，因为考试中心有语言区别。名额限制根据以往应试者的数量按比例划分。同时还会考虑以往退考者比例，安排考试地点。  

**报名人数满额之后呢?**

打算报考的应试者在相应应试者群体报考人数尚未满额之前可以进行考试注册。由于不同应试者群体报考名额限制不同，某个群体报考人数满额并不影响其他尚未满额的群体继续进行考试报名。  

某个应试者群体报考人数一旦满额，该群体应试者在考试报名过程中会被通知报考名额已满，是否希望预先注册下次考试。  

在2015年秋季考试普通注册开放之前，预先注册名单中的应试者将可以选择注册2016年春季MCCQE第二部分考试。2016年春季预先注册只适用于在2015年秋季考试注册期间已经开始报考流程但是由于相应群体报考名额已满无法递交报名申请的应试者。  

**为什么2015年秋季MCCQE第二部分考试采用了报考名额限制?**

最近5年，MCCQE第二部分考试报考人数急剧上升。因为每年的春季考试和秋季考试应试者人数分布几乎差不多，所以考试地点可以容纳这些增加的应试者。目前，随着自2016年起家庭医学将采用全新考试结构的公布，MCC预计2015年秋季MCCQE第二部分考试应试者将会非常多。  

为了解决这个问题，MCC反复考虑了7种不同的解决办法，最终决定实行各个应试者群体报考名额限制。这样MCC不仅能够保持考试分数严格有效，而且还可以保证春秋季考试都可以有尽可能多的考试中心。  

**考试人数会增加吗?**

MCC已经在2015年秋季考试中增加了考试人数，比2014年秋季考试人数多7%。2016年秋季考试人数将进一步增加。由于没有其他类似考试，所以考试人数将会继续增加。而类似考试中的考点将会转变成MCCQE第二部分考试。

**应试者会进入候补名单吗?**

为了保证考试的公平性，MCC决定在所有应试者群体中将以往退考率计入考试地点，而不实行候补名单。  

因为实行候补名单可能会影响考试的公平性。例如，注册时间关闭之后如果有应试者退出了考试，候补名单上不同群体应试者可以有机会参加考试。但是候补名单之外的应试者将不会被考虑在内，因为每次考试还必须保证一定数量的第一次参加考试的加拿大毕业生。  

**报考名额限制会影响应试者选择考试中心吗?**

报考名额限制不影响应试者选择考试中心。具体群体，例如第一次参见考试的英语考区加拿大毕业生，报考人数满额之后，该群体中的其他应试者将被通知该报考名额已满。特殊3个群体各有名额限制，并根据语言不同进行了进一步的划分，但是不会收到应试者考试中心选择的影响。

**Candidate orientation presentation**

The interactive orientation presentation is now available.

**资格考试目标**

加拿大医学委员会把**资格考试目标**作为MCCQE第一部分和第二部分考试的考查基础。这些目标是依据合格医生具备的一些考试行为制定的，体现了对合格医生的一些预期。  

预防比治疗更有效，只有诊断之后才可以进行合理治疗。这些目标主要关于数据采集、诊断并临床解决医学难题以及一些管理原则，这些都部分或整体适用于医生接触的临床案例。  

MCCQE第二部分考试以病人的一些与规定**目标**相关的常见临床表现或者疑难杂症为基础。请根据**资格考试目标**进行针对性学习，而不是以疾病或体系为参照进行学习。无论是自己还是与他人一起研究在不同学科中出现的一些常见难题或疑难杂症，这些都将有助于熟悉考试形式。对于每一个临床表现都应该鉴别关键诊断、诊断所需的关键信息（消除区别诊断），处理，列出有关身体检查的一些关键方面，考虑调查所需要的东西，以及概括每个难题初期管理的一些关键方面。    

**DSM-5过渡**

2013年5月**美国精神病科协会**发布了**精神障碍诊断和统计手册**的第五个版本（DSM-5)。  

从2014年到2015年，以计算机为基础的MCCEE考题将更新使用DSM-5最新语言，这些更新的考题将继续使用DSM-IV-TR语言，不同的一点是，其前面会附上DSM-5术语。  

应试者在回答监考医生提出的问题时或者在分钟的互动后测试环节书面作答时，可以根据需要使用DSM-5或者使用DSM-IV-TR。

**参考书目**

加拿大考试委员会编纂了一系列参考书目，将有助于考试备考。  

**常见错误**

参加OSCE考试时一定要仔细查看应试者在考试中经常犯的一些错误，为考试做准备。  

**其他重要信息**

请阅读**如何准备OSCE考试**。

> 
> ## Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination Part II ##
> 
> The Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination Part II assesses the competence of candidates, specifically the knowledge, skills, and attitudes essential for medical licensure in Canada prior to entry into independent clinical practice.
> 
> This examination consists of a series of clinical stations including pilot stations that do not count towards a candidate’s total score. At each station, a brief written statement introduces a clinical problem and directs the candidate to appropriately examine a standardized (simulated) patient as well as perform activities such as obtaining a focused history, conducting a focused physical examination, or assessing and addressing the patient’s issues. Candidates may be asked to answer specific questions related to the patient, interpret X-rays or the results of other investigations, make a diagnosis and/or write admission orders.
> 
> This examination includes problems in Medicine, Pediatrics, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Preventive Medicine and Community Health, Psychiatry and Surgery, as well as in similar disciplines considered essential for competence in general medicine and health care.
> 
> As a result of the new exam structure for family medicine starting in 2016, MCC is seeing increased candidate demand for the MCCQE Part II across sessions. Capacity limits were in place for the fall 2015 MCCQE Part II. Candidates who attempted to apply for the fall 2015 MCCQE Part II after capacity limits had been reached were able to select to be added to a preregistration list for the spring 2016 MCCQE Part II.
> 
> Candidates on the pre-registration list will be able to apply during the pre-registration period in November 2015. General registration, which will open after the pre-registration period has closed, will be available to all physicians who have completed their training or who are in their PGY-2 year or above. MCC expects to have enough capacity during the pre-registration and general registration periods for all eligible PGY-2+ candidates (including physicians who have completed their training).
> 
> New this year – the MCC has changed the eligibility criteria for the MCCQE Part II . PGY-1 candidates completing their first year of residency by June 30, 2016, will be able to apply to the spring 2016 MCCQE Part II. The registration period for PGY-1 candidates will open in January 2016, and capacity will be very limited.
> 
> **Application for the spring 2016 MCCQE Part II**
> 
> MCC will provide three application periods for the spring 2016 MCCQE Part II:
> 
> - The pre-registration period – opening the week of Nov. 16, 2015
>   - This registration period is available only for those candidates who are on the pre-registration list
>   - These candidates attempted to apply for fall 2015 after the exam capacity was reached and could not complete the application process at that time, and selected to place their name on the pre-registration list
> - General application will open during the week of Nov. 23, 2015
> - PGY-1 registration – expected to open the week of Jan. 4, 2016
> 
> 
> - For information regarding centre assignment, please visit the Centre selection page
> - The MCCQE Part II centres are not bilingual; each centre is designated as either English (E) or French (F)
> - Candidates will be scheduled for two short sessions over the two days of the weekend

> ### Exam capacity ###
> 
> 
> **How will the capacity limits be applied?**
> 
> Note: Application to the MCCQE Part II is now closed. We anticipate that application to the spring 2016 MCCQE Part II exam will open in November 2015.
> 
> 
> The MCC must ensure that a large enough sample of first-time Canadian graduate candidates take the exam in each session to maintain the reliability, validity and comparability of scores.
> 
> Having a large enough sample of first-time Canadian graduate candidates in each session ensures that candidates taking the exam in a given session are not penalized or advantaged if they receive more difficult or easier OSCE stations. The level of difficulty can be determined and exam scores adjusted.
> 
> Capacity limits are also in place for other candidates. This will ensure that the exam is taken by a diverse group of candidates across both sessions, thus enabling physician examiners to better assess against a common standard.
> 
> MCC reserved a proportional number of spots in the fall 2015 MCCQE Part II session for eligible candidates who will pass the spring 2015 MCCQE Part I or fail the spring 2015 MCCQE Part II.
> 
> The caps for these three groups (first-time Canadian graduates; IMGs, US graduates and Canadian graduate repeat test takers; and candidates receiving results from the spring exams) have been further subdivided by English and French exam spots, as exam centres are language-specific. The caps have been proportionally set based on historical candidate volumes. Historical withdrawal rates were also taken into account and added to the number of spots available.
> 
> **What happens after a capacity limit is reached?**
> 
> Candidates who apply will be able to register until the cap for their group has been reached. Depending on the rate of application, candidates in certain groups will be able to continue to apply for the exam after capacity has been reached for other groups.
> 
> Once the limit has been reached for a specific group, candidates from that group going through the application process will be notified that spots are no longer available, and will be asked whether they want to be added to a pre-registration list for the following session.
> 
> Candidates on the pre-registration list will be provided the option of registering for the spring 2016 MCCQE Part II before general registration opens in fall 2015. The option of being added to the spring 2016 pre-registration list will only be available during the fall 2015 exam’s registration period to candidates who started the application process and could not submit an application because the limit had been reached for their group.
> 
> **Why are capacity limits being introduced for the fall 2015 MCCQE Part II?**
> 
> Over the past five years, there has been a significant increase in the number of candidates taking the MCCQE Part II. Exam sites have been able to accommodate the increased candidate numbers because they were more or less evenly distributed over the spring and fall session every year. Now, with the announcement of a new exam structure for family medicine starting in 2016, MCC is expecting that candidate demand for the fall 2015 MCCQE Part II will be very high.
> 
> After exploring several options to address this issue, the MCC will implement specific capacity limits – or caps – across candidate groups. This approach will allow the MCC to maintain the rigour and psychometric validity of exam scores while also ensuring that the exam will be offered in as many centres as possible across both the spring and fall sessions.
> 
> **Can the exam capacity be increased?**
> 
> The MCC has already added capacity to the fall 2015 exam (more than seven per cent increase over fall 2014 candidate volumes). We will also add more candidate spots in the fall of 2016. Additional capacity will be available given that the harmonized examination will not be offered. The “spots” from the harmonized exam will be transferred to the MCCQE Part II.
> 
> **Can candidates be added to a wait list?**
> 
> To be equitable, the MCC decided to add historical withdrawal rates to the number of spots available across all candidate groups instead of implementing a waiting list.
> 
> Implementing a waiting list might negatively impact fairness for candidates. For example, if we had someone withdraw after the registration closed, we would have candidates from the different groups on the waiting list. We would not necessarily be able to offer the spot to the person “next on the list”, given that we also have to ensure that a minimum number of first-time Canadian graduates take the exam across both sessions.
> 
> **Are the limits impacted by the candidate’s centre choices?**
> 
> The capacity limits are independent of the candidate’s centre choices. Once capacity has been reached for a given group (e.g., for English first-time Canadian graduates), any additional candidate from that group will be notified that this limit has been reached. Separate limits have been established for the three groups and then further sub-divided by language, but they are not impacted by the candidate’s centre choices.

> 
> The Medical Council of Canada uses the Objectives for the Qualifying Examination as the basis for the MCCQE Part I and II. The Objectives have been defined in behavioural terms, and reflect our expectations of competent physicians.
> 
> The assumption has been made that it is better to prevent than treat, and that rational treatment is possible only after a diagnosis has been established. The Objectives deal with data gathering, diagnostic clinical problem solving, and the principles of management, which are applicable, in part of or whole, to clinical situations faced by physicians.
> 
> The MCCQE Part II is based on common or critical patient presentations related to the Objectives. Consider organizing your study similarly, rather than studying by disease or body system. Working from common or critical presenting problems from different disciplines, by yourself or with others, will align your studying with the format of the examination. For each patient presentation, identify key diagnoses, the critical information needed for diagnosis (and to rule out the differential diagnoses) and to treat, list key aspects of the physical examination, and consider what investigations might be needed, as well as summarizing key aspects of initial management of each problem.

### 评分 ###

**概述**

MCCQE第二部分考试采用单独评分方式，与MCCQE第一部分考试毫无关联。但是，应试者必须同时通过MCCQE第一部分考试和第二部分考试，才会获得LMCC证书。  

MCCQE第二部分考试和所有MCC考试一样都是标准参照考试。这就意味着只要应试者达到或超过考试标准就能通过考试，而不会受到其他应试者表现的影响。 

MCCQE第二部分考试部分由监考医生根据应试者在每个考试点的表现进行评估。  

** OSCE评分方式**

OSCE各个检查点都比较客观，因为它们都采用了标准的指导方针，监考医生和标准化病人都经过严格培训，而且每个检查点都使用针对性的评分工具。  

OSCE检查点由监考医生根据一张评分表进行打分。此外，在几乎所有的检查点，监考医生也会根据等级量表对应试者与病人之间的互动进行评分。例如，监考医生可能会根据**提问技巧**和/或**身体检查组织能力**和/或**与他人相处**对应试者进行等级划分。  

当应试者在某些检查点必须对书面问题作答时，其在分钟的互动后测试的作答也将参与评分。监考医生在考试结束之后再对应试者的作答进行评分。

应试者应该表现得体、专业、不违背道德规范。监考医生填写监考医生评分表之后，必须回答应试者的考试表现是否合格，如果不合格，必须明确指出哪些考试表现不合格。此外，监考医生还必须回答：该应试者是否有任何违背专业道德的行为。如果回答是**是**，监考医生还必须详细指出其具体行为。

**MCCQE第二部分考试如何计算总分数？如何计算各项分数?**

所有考试点的评分标准都是一样的，而应试者的总分数是其所有考试点分数的平均分。该分数反映了应试者在特定考试时间在所有考试点所经历的考试难度。MCC评分报告都采用50到950分的标准评分形式。  

各项分数计算方式是把12个检查点的每项都折合成百分比，最后取所有百分比的平均数。MCCQE第二部分考试总共包含4项得分，即：数据采集、问题解决与决策、病人/医生交流以及医学实践领域内有关文化交流、法律、道德和组织方面的考虑。  

**如何确定合格分数?**

加拿大医务委员会每3到5年就会举行一次标准设定练习，以确保考试标准以及合格分数的合理性。标准设定这个流程是用来确定合格的考试表现水平并制定考试合格分数。  

为了这个最终目的，加拿大医务委员会咨询了20位来自全国各地、可以代表所有医学院的医生的意见，因为他们不仅各有所长，而且都具有多年监督医学生和住院医师的经验，之后才进行了严格的标准设定练习。MCC所使用的Borderline Group Method一直被世界上许多大型考试项目所运用。标准设定练习之后，中央考试委员会提出了实行这种全新的合格分数，该建议接受审查并获得了通过。中央考试委员会的成员是来自全国各地的医生和医学教育者，且嗾使考试委员会成员，由MCC负责选拔。该委员会负责保证考试质量并为所以应试者评定最终考试结果。  

所有2015年春季MCCQE第一部分考试的应试者的考试成绩考虑在内之后，才确立了平均分是500、标准偏差是100的新范围。2015年春季考试以及随后的考试都将根据这个新范围记录考试成绩，这样就可以对参加2015年秋季之后考试的应试者的考试表现进行比较。例如，如果将来的某次考试平均分是510分，那么此次考试应试者的表现比平均分是500分的2015年春季那次考试应试者的表现好。在该新范围下，由常设考试小组建议并获得通过的合格分数是509分，该合格分数将会在将来的MCCQE第二部分考试中一直适用。  

2015年之前，MCCQE第二部分考试在原来50分到950分的分数基础上合格分数是475分，而2015年之后，在原来分数基础上合格分数将由原来的509分降到494分。  

**如何判断合格还是不合格?**

应试者最终考试结果取决于其总分与考试合格分数之间的差异。总分大于等于合格分数，考试结果就是合格；总分小于合格分数，考试结果就是不合格。而应试者的考试表现根据考试合格分数判断，并不是通过其他应试者的表现判断。

**考试成绩单和补充性反馈报告都包含什么内容?**

SOR包含应试者的最终考试结果、考试总分以及合格分数。其他信息包括总分和各项分数都由SFR提供。总分采用50到950分的标准分数范围。SFR中**第一项**中的分数显示的是应试者各项分数，表明其在4个方面的优势和劣势。所以，总分数和SFR中的分数无法进行比较，因为它们采用不同的评分范围。SOR和SFR可以通过physiciansapply.ca account查看。 

**自2015年起关于补充性反馈报告的变化**

之前的补充性反馈报告包含一个图表，该图表依据考试表现好坏依次列出各个检查点。自2015年起，MCC将该图表从补充性反馈报告中删除，因为图表包含的信息尽管正确但容易解读错误和/或容易误导人。  

该图表将各个检查点划分了等级，但是，实际上应试者在各个检查点的表现在某些情况下是相同（接近相同）或者没有差异的。 出现这样的变动之后，2015年的补充性反馈报告将由2页内容变成1页内容。

### 考试结果 ###

**考试结果公布**

考试结果由MCC中央考试委员会负责确认，因为它负责管理每年6月份春季考试和12月份秋季考试。  

MCC中央考试委员会确认考试结果之后，应试者会收到一封电子邮件，通知其可以通过physiciansapply.ca个人账户查看自己合格/不合格考试结果。之后，应试者的physiciansapply.ca个人账户很快就会收到一份考试成绩单和一份补充性反馈报告。考试合格的应试者还会收到MCC寄送的证书。    

当应试者申请的组织要求其提供考试成绩单和补充性反馈报告的认证复件时，应试者可以申请MCC发送认证复件，但是，必须支付一定的服务费。  

为了避免发生任何错误或欺诈行为，同时出于保密性的需要，考试结果将不会通过电话、传真或电子邮件公布。 

**考试结果通知方式**

MCC通过physiciansapply.ca向应试者发送一份考试成绩单，该声明包含应试者最终考试结果、总分以及合格分数。除此之外，MCC还会通过physiciansapply.ca对应试者的考试表现进行补充性反馈。MCC还准备了辅助文件帮助应试者解读自己在MCCQE第二部分考试中的补充性反馈报告。

**证书**

为了能确保收到考试证书，应试者应该保证MCC记录的是最新的邮寄地址。如果邮寄地址出现变动，应试者应该在MCC邮寄证书之前2周通知其变更的邮寄地址。如果应试者没有及时通知MCC，那么必须等到原件返回MCC后，由MCC寄送到新地址。应试者应该通过physiciansapply.ca个人账户更新个人邮寄地址。  

**考试失败**

尽管MCC不限制MCCQE第二部分考试应试者参加考试的次数，但是，通过考试的应试者不可以再次报考以期刷新考试成绩。

**请求重新评分**

只有没有通过MCCQE第二部分考试的应试者才可以请求重新评分；凡是通过该考试的应试者都不可以申请重新评分。  

应试者必须了解在考试结果公布之前考试分数会反复核查，因此，即使进行重新评分考试结果也不可能有任何改变。  

打算请求重新评分的应试者必须：  

- 通过physiciansapply.ca个人账户递交相关信息，包括请求重新评分的原因以及邮寄地址。  
- 填写信用卡认证表，其中包含相关费用。  
- 勾选**同意**MCCQE第二部分考试重新评分请求。  
- 将完整表格发送邮件到service@mcc.ca或发送传真到613-248-5234。  

如果最终考试结果有所变化，将退还重新评分相关费用。  

申请MCCQE第二部分考试重新评分的截止时间是：9月1日（春季考试）和3月1日（秋季考试）。  

MCCQE第二部分考试重新评分包括如下步骤：  

- 各个考试部分的证明，包括一份完整评审文件（事件报告和医生意见）。  
- 计算机扫描答卷异常的认证，包括试卷破损、污迹等。  
- 医生鉴定完整的答卷与原始计算机数据不一致的认证。  
- 成绩单上的分数与计算机储存分数不一致的认证。  

重新评分**不包括**其他监考员对应试者的考试表现进行重新评估。

如果重新评分之后考试结果有所变化，MCC会通过physiciansapply.ca为应试者重新出具考试成绩单和补充性反馈报告，并且会向应试者寄送证书。  

重新评分请求自收到之后4到6周内会进行处理。

**投诉**

当MCCQE第二部分考试的应试者被取消考试资格，包括以任何形式被拒绝报考将来的考试，或者认为考试结果有失公允时，可以向**投诉委员会**提出投诉。应试者不可以对考试内容提出任何投诉。  

如果你打算提出投诉，必须在收到**中央考试委员会**决定之后45天之内书面通知**执行董事**。

> 
> ### Scoring ###
> 
> **Overview**
> 
> The Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination (MCCQE) Part II is scored independently of the MCCQE Part I. To be awarded the Licentiate of the Medical Council of Canada (LMCC), a candidate must pass both the MCCQE Part I and Part II.
> 
> The MCCQE Part II, like all Medical Council of Canada (MCC) exams is a criterion-referenced exam. This means that candidates who meet or exceed the standard will pass the exam regardless of how well other candidates perform on it.
> 
> The MCCQE Part II component is evaluated by physician examiners based on the candidate’s performance at each station.
> 
> **How are OSCE stations scored**
> 
> Objectivity is achieved through the use of standardized guidelines, the training of physician examiners and of standardized patients, and the use of predetermined station-specific scoring instruments for objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) stations.
> 
> OSCE stations are scored by the physician examiner using a checklist of tasks (see sample OSCE cases below for details). In almost all stations, the physician examiner also scores selected rating scale items related to the candidate’s interactions with the patient. For example, the physician examiner may be rating the candidate on “Questioning Skills” and/or “Organization of Physical Examination” and/or “Rapport with Person”.
> 
> In the case of couplet stations where the candidate is required to answer written questions, the candidate is also scored on his or her answers in the post-encounter probe. Physician examiners score candidates’ answers following the exam. For examples of the post-encounter probe questions and the correct answers, view the post-encounter probe for the history-taking station or the physical examination station below.
> 
> Candidates are expected to demonstrate appropriate, ethical and professional behaviour. When filling out the physician examiner checklist, physician examiners are asked whether the candidate’s performance was unsatisfactory and to specify the reason(s) for the unsatisfactory performance. Physician examiners must also answer the question: Did this candidate demonstrate a lapse in professional behaviour? If answering “yes”, the physician examiners must then elaborate on the observed lapse.
> 
> **How are total scores and subscores calculated on the MCCQE Part II?**
> 
> Each station is worth the same as every other station and a candidate’s total score is the average of his or her station scores. The total score is adjusted to reflect the level of difficulty of the stations experienced by candidates on a given exam date. The MCC reports scores on a standard-score format ranging from 50 to 950.
> 
> Sub-scores are calculated by converting each item to a percentage (i.e., checklist, rating scale, written or oral questions) across the 12 stations and taking the average of the percentages associated with each domain. There are four domain sub-scores reported on the MCCQE Part II: Data Acquisition, Problem Solving and Decision Making, Patient/Physician Interaction, and C²LEO (the Considerations of the Cultural-Communication, Legal, Ethical, and Organizational aspects of the practice of medicine).
> 
> **How is the pass score established?**
> 
> 
> The MCC conducts a standard setting exercise every three to five years to ensure that the standard and the pass score remain appropriate. Standard setting is a process used to define an acceptable level of performance and to establish a pass score.
> 
> To this end, the MCC completed a rigorous standard setting exercise based on expert judgments from a panel of 20 physicians across the country that represented faculties of medicine, different specialties, and years of experience supervising students and residents. The Borderline Group Method used by MCC has been successfully employed (and defended) with a number of large-scale exam programs around the world. Following the standard setting exercise, the new pass score was brought forward to the Central Examination Committee (CEC) which reviewed and approved the recommendation. The CEC is represented by physicians and medical educators from across the country. The members of this Committee are chairs of our examination test committees and are appointed by Council. The CEC is responsible for the quality of our examinations and awards final results to our candidates (e.g., pass, fail).
> 
> Using the spring 2015 results of all MCCQE Part II candidates, the new scale was established to have a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100. Candidate results from the spring 2015 and subsequent exam sessions will be reported on this new scale allowing us to compare candidate performance across sessions beginning with the spring 2015 session. For example, a mean score of 510 on a future administration would indicate a stronger performance of that group than the spring 2015 group that had a mean of 500. On this new scale, the pass score that was recommended from the standard setting panel and approved by the CEC is 509. This pass score will remain in place for subsequent MCCQE Part II sessions.
> 
> Prior to 2015, the pass score for the MCCQE Part II was 475 on the old 50 to 950 scale. The new pass score (509) translates to 494 on the old scale.
> 
> **How is a pass/fail decision made?**
> 
> A candidate’s final result (e.g., pass, fail) is determined by his or her total score and where it falls in relation to the examination pass score. A total score equal to or greater than the pass score is a pass and a total score less than the pass score is a fail. The candidate’s performance is judged in relation to the examination pass score and not judged on how well other individuals performed.
> 
> **What will appear on the Statement of Results (SOR) and on the Supplemental Feedback Report (SFR)?**
> 
> The SOR includes the candidate’s final result and total score, as well as the pass score. Additional information about the total and sub-scores is provided on the SFR. The total score is reported on a standard-score scale ranging from 50 to 950. In contrast, the score profile in Figure 1 of the SFR displays a candidate’s domain sub-scores that indicate a candidate’s relative strengths and weaknesses in four areas. As a result, total scores cannot be compared to the score profile in the SFR as both are reported on different scales. Both the SOR and the SFR are made available through the candidate’s physiciansapply.ca account.
> 
> **New in 2015 – changes to the SFR**
> 
> Candidates from previous sessions may recall that their report contained a table with stations listed from high performance to low performance. As of 2015, the MCC has removed this table from the SFR as the information it contained, while correct, could be misinterpreted and/or misleading.
> 
> The table provided a rank order of stations, but candidate performance in some cases was equal, close to equal, or not equidistant across all stations. As a result of this change, in 2015 the report will be one page instead of two.

> 
> ### Results ###
> 
> **Release of results**
> 
> Examination results are confirmed by the MCC Central Examination Committee, which meets in June for the spring administration and in December for the fall administration.
> 
> After result confirmation, candidates will receive an email notification stating that they can verify their pass/fail result through their physiciansapply.ca account. The Statement of Results and the supplemental feedback report will be posted in candidates’ physiciansapply.ca accounts shortly thereafter. For candidates who have passed the examination, the MCC will also send out a package by mail with the candidate’s Licentiate documents.
> 
> Candidates applying to an organization that requires submission of certified copies of the Statement of Results or the supplemental feedback report can request that the MCC send certified copies. There is an administrative fee for this service
> 
> To prevent errors or fraud and for reasons of confidentiality, results cannot be given over the phone, by fax or by email.
> 
> **How results are communicated**
> 
> The Medical Council of Canada (MCC) issues candidates a Statement of Results through their physiciansapply.ca account. The Statement of Results includes the candidate’s final result and final score as well as the score that was required to pass the examination. The MCC also provides supplemental feedback on candidates’ examination performance through their physiciansapply.ca account. The MCC has prepared a help file to assist candidates in interpreting their MCCQE Part II supplemental feedback report.
> 
> **Licenciate packages**
> 
> Candidates should ensure that the mailing address the MCC has on file is up to date so that the Licentiate packages are sent to the correct address. The MCC must receive an address change at least two weeks before the mailing of Licentiate packages. If a candidate does not submit a change in address, he or she will be required to wait for the original package to be returned to the MCC so that it can be redirected to the new address. Candidates should update their mailing address through their physiciansapply.ca account.
> 
> **Fails**
> 
> The MCC does not limit the number of times a candidate may attempt the MCCQE Part II. However, candidates with a pass result on the MCCQE Part II cannot retake the examination in an attempt to obtain a higher score.
> 
> **Rescore requests**
> 
> 
> 
> Only candidates who have failed the MCCQE Part II can request a rescore; candidates with a pass result are not eligible for the rescoring service.
> 
> It is important for candidates to note that scores are verified several times before results are released. Given this scrutiny, it is unlikely that rescoring the examination will produce a change in result.
> 
> Candidates who wish to have their examination rescored must:
> 
> - Submit a message through their physiciansapply.ca account that includes an explanation for the rescore request and their mailing address
> - Complete a Credit card authorization form including the applicable fee
> - Check the box next to “Other Fee” and indicate “Rescore request – MCCQE Part II
> - Send the completed form by email (service@mcc.ca) or fax (613-248-5234)
> 
> Fees are refunded if a rescore leads to a change in the final result (i.e., change from fail to pass).
> 
> Deadlines for filing MCCQE Part II rescore requests are September 1 for the spring exam and March 1 for the fall exam.
> 
> An MCCQE Part II rescore includes the following steps:
> 
> - Authentication of all parts of your examination, including a complete file review (incident reports and physician comments)
> - Verification of the computer-scanned answer sheets for anomalies (torn sheets, stray marks, ink marks, etc.)
> - Verification of raw computer data against physician-completed answer sheets
> - Verification of the computer file scores against those reported in the result letter
> 
> A rescore does NOT include a re-evaluation of the candidate’s performance by additional examiners.
> 
> If the rescoring produces a change in final result, the MCC will issue a new Statement of Results and Supplemental Feedback Report to the candidate through his or her physiciansapply.ca account. The MCC will also send out a package by mail with the candidate’s Licentiate documents.
> 
> Rescores are processed within four to six weeks from the date they are received.
> 
> **Appeals**
> 
> Any MCCQE Part II candidate who has been denied standing, including any denial of entry to future examinations, or who considers that the results of an examination have been prejudiced by the conduct of the examination may appeal to the Appeals Committee. Candidates cannot seek to appeal the content on the examination.
> 
> Any candidate wishing to launch an appeal must notify the Executive Director in writing within 45 days of the decision of the Central Examination Committee. For more information on the appeal process for the MCCQE Part II, please review the MCC bylaws.
