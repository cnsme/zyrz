## Island Technology Professionals of Prince Edward Island ##

Formed in 1972 under the name PEISCETT (PEI Society of Certified Engineering Technicians & Technologists), our association is now known as Island Technology Professionals (ITP). We are Prince Edward Island's independent certifying body for engineering/applied science technicians and technologists.

ITP confers the designations "C.Tech.", "C.E.T." and "A.Sc.T." which are symbols of achievement in engineering/applied science technology and are legally protected for use only by fully certified members. The designations are recognized across Canada by many employers and other engineering professionals through the efforts of the provincial associations that make up the Canadian Council of Technicians and Technologists (CCTT).

Applicants must have both education and experience qualifications in a recognized field of engineering technology and were trained in a recognized institution.

## Professional Practice Examinations ##

### Introduction ###

The Provincial Constituent Members of the Canadian Council of Technicians and Technologists have agreed that all new applicants for technician and technologist certification will be required to write a Professional Practice Exam based on ethics and other areas of importance to practicing technicians and technologists.

Accordingly, the ITP Council has stipulated that as of September 1st, 2006 all applicants who apply for certification will be required to write an exam which contains questions on the ITP Code of Ethics and Interpretation Guidelines. The exam will consist of twenty-five multiple choice questions.

Applicants will be required to study information consisting of the following:

**ITP Code of Ethics** and Interpretation Guidelines ([available for download here](http://techpei.ca/pdfs/ITP_Code_of_Ethics.pdf)) and we suggest “The Canadian Professional Engineering Practice and Ethics” by Gorden C. Andrews and John D. Kemper. (chapters 6 to 11) (questions 19 to 25 are based on these chapters).

The applicant is to complete the Professional Practice Exam and return with their application for certification. The onus is on the applicant to obtain a copy of “The Canadian Professional Engineering Practice and Ethics”, copies of this book can be found at the Holland College library Charlottetown, and can be signed out.

Note:

Applicants of who have had an "Ethics course" included as part of an accredited program, will not have to do an ethics exam as part of their application process as long as they provide proof of passing such course in their application package
