笔试规定：详情见下表

![](http://ww3.sinaimg.cn/mw690/67e2e798gw1ev931k0u1ij20o00lyq61.jpg)

> The Competency Examination for Doctor of TCM consists of two parts. Part 1 is a written examination and Part 2 is a clinical examination. Candidates are required to pass the written exam before advancing to take the clinical exam. Upon passing the written exam, the candidate will be automatically scheduled for the next upcoming clinical exam. The written and clinical parts each provide different information about a candidate’s knowledge and skills. Part 1, the written portion, consists of multiple-choice items to assess the candidate’s knowledge of basic concepts and the application of acquired knowledge to practical situations and problems. Part 2, the clinical examination, consists of two case studies. The clinical examination is designed to simulate and reflect typical patient - Dr.TCM interaction. The candidate will be required to interview two standardized patients (one female and one male). For each standardized patient, the candidate needs to make a diagnosis and to develop a treatment plan (including an herbal formulation and other modalities of TCM treatment such as acupuncture).
> 
> Part 1 Written Examination (Multiple-Choice):
> 
> The Part 1 Written Examination consists of 200 multiple-choice items. All 200 items are of equal value. Candidates should, therefore, attempt to answer every item.
> 
> The time allotted for the written examination is 4 hours.
> 
> All multiple choice items are comprised of a question or incomplete statement followed by four (4) alternative options. Candidates must indicate the best option for an item to receive a mark for that item. The questions may be based on concepts, theories, clinical situations or diagrams. Examples of the different types of items and instructions for answering the items are provided in Appendix A.
> 
> The scope of the written examination corresponds with the Core Competencies of Doctor of TCM in British Columbia (available from the College for $20 a copy, or from the College’s website at no charge at http://www.ctcma.bc.ca/index.php?id=67).
> 
> Acupuncture points selected for examination will be referred to by the Pinyin names and WHO standard nomenclature. For extra points, Reference Code will also be used wherever possible.
> 
> WRITTEN EXAMINATION SPECIFICATIONS
> 
> The following table outlines the subject areas that will be examined in the Dr.TCM written examination. The percentages listed on the right indicate the weight of each subject area in the written examination. 
> 
> ![](http://ww3.sinaimg.cn/mw690/67e2e798gw1ev931k0u1ij20o00lyq61.jpg)

第二部分：临床考试-交流、诊断、治疗方案

临床考试包含2个案例分析，考察以下方面的临床技能：4项检查技能、收集信息、解决问题、分析数据、治疗方案、选择药方并适当修改、选择针灸穴位、其他中医治疗方式（艾炙法、推拿法、拔罐法）、解释专业行为和交流技巧。该类型考试旨在考察临床实践技能。

2个案例分析题

每个案例分析中，申请人与符合标准的病人交流30分钟。之后，有40分钟时间填写笔试表。

字迹书写要清晰易读。书写潦草不清晰的试卷不给分。

符合标准的病人是指经过训练，能够切合实际地再现真正病人过去、生理和情绪状态的人。他们能对所有申请人展现相同的行为状态。

病人的一些信息（主要诉求）会提供给申请人。申请人通过交流收集病人信息，同时，有2个监考人在旁边。为保持考题的一致性，每个病人会拿着写有各种关于他们自己情况信息的卡片，必要时会读给申请人。信息包括舌头外观、CBC测试（全血球计数）结果。

每个案例分析中，申请人需要对病人进行中医检查和西医初步检查（你认为的西医检查可能是：II型糖尿病），考察病因和病理方面的知识。治疗中，申请人需对病人的膳食结构、生活方式、锻炼、疾病预防措施等方面提出建议。

临床考试分值：

考官给出书面答案分数，符合标准的病人给出分数单，两部分共同组成该申请人临床考试的总分数。评分准则：与病人交流的沟通能力（态度是否专业）、医术（是否按合理的逻辑进行检查）。符合要求的病人对申请人的沟通能力和医术给出分值。

预计临床考试时间为2小时20分钟，与病人沟通部分会被录像。

> Part 2: The Clinical Examination: Interview, Diagnosis and Treatment Plan
> 
> The Part 2 clinical examination consists of two case studies designed to assess the candidate’s clinical skills in areas including: performing the four examinations;collecting information; problem solving; interpreting data; treatment planning; selecting herbal formulas and doing modifications; selecting acupuncture points;selecting other TCM treatment modalities such as moxibustion, tui na and cupping; and demonstrating professional behavior and communication skills. This type of examination is designed to assess the candidate’s skills in situations simulated to reflect actual clinical practice.
> 
> Two Case Studies
> 
> In each case study, the candidate will have 30 minutes to interview a standardized patient. After this time period is up the candidate will have 40 minutes to fill out a written test sheet.
> 
> Handwriting must be clear and legible. Illegible writing will be disregarded.
> 
> A standardized patient is a person who has been trained to realistically reproduce the history and the physical and emotional state of an actual patient. Standardized patients are trained to act in the same way with all the candidates. 
> 
> The candidate will be given general information about the patient including the chief compliant. During the interview the candidate will collect information from the standardized patient as they would in a normal clinical setting while being observed by two examiners. In order to maintain consistency the standardized patient will have cards containing a variety of information about their condition which will be read to the candidate when necessary, i.e. the appearance of the tongue, or the results of a CBC lab test (complete blood count). 
> 
> In each case study, the candidate will be required to give a TCM diagnosis as well as a western medical “impression” (what you think the Western Medical diagnosis would be, i.e. diabetes type II). The candidate will be tested on the etiology and pathology of the case. Candidates should be prepared to give suggestions for dietary changes, lifestyle changes, exercise, and possible precautions in treating the patient.
> 
> Scoring of the Clinical Examination 
> 
> The candidate will be scored by their written responses and by score sheets completed by the examiners and by the standardized patient. There will be two examiners observing the interview phase of the case. The candidate will be evaluated on their interview skills including interaction with the patient (i.e. in a professional manner) and their technical skills (i.e. did they proceed in a logical manner). The standardized  patient will complete a score sheet on the behavior and communication skills of the candidate.
> 
> It is anticipated that the clinical examination will take approximately 2 hours and 20 minutes to complete. The interview portion with the standardized patient may be videotaped.
