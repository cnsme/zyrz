## 保险委员会考试流程 ##

考试流程和执照申请过程是分开的。考试注册人需要通过必须的考试来满足教育标准,满足许可过程中的一些要求。

考试申请表格:注册人需要完成并且提交考试登记表给曼尼托巴省保险委员会。

考试费用:考试费用必须和申请一起提交。每项考试110加币,费用可以现金、汇票、公司支票或者经过认证的个人支票形式支付。信用卡或者借记卡付款形式是不允许的。费用是不可退回的。

**一般保险代理人和保险理算员考试注册人:**

曼尼托巴省保险委员会一旦接收到以下材料就会联系注册人来安排考试日期:(1)考试申请表格(2)不可退回的考试费用。

人寿保险和意外伤害和疾病(accident and sickness)保险考试注册人:人寿保险和意外伤害和疾病保险考试注册人必须要提供人寿保险资格证书结业证书或者确保曼尼托巴省保险委员会在考试注册之前直接从人寿保险资格证书提供者那里收到结业证书。证书上的名字和注册人将在考试当日使用的来证明他/她的身份的附带照片的证件上的名字一致是十分重要的。如果名字不一致,注册人将不会被允许参加考试。

曼尼托巴省保险委员会一旦接收到以下材料就会联系注册人来安排考试日期:(1)考试申请表格;(2)人寿保险资格证结业证书;(3)不可退回的考试费用。考试必须在收到曼尼托巴省保险委员会考试要求的30天内参加。

通过必须的考试的个人可以继续完成和提交申请许可的申请给曼尼托巴省保险委员会。申请人回答申请中的每一个问题并且提交所有清单中要求和注明的文件是十分重要的,例如:犯罪记录检查、符合曼尼托巴省要求的职业责任政策、完整的鉴定证书(如果是新的人寿保险代理人)、经过批准和授权的保证人的签字等。

直至申请被曼尼托巴省保险委员会核准并且授予执照,申请人是没有许可证的,而且不能出任保险代理。不完整的申请会导致延期;所以提交完整的申请和要求的文件对于申请人是有益处的。

> 
> Examination Application Form: The registrant will complete and submit the Examination Registration Form to the ICM.
> 
> Exam Fees: The exam fee must accompany the application. The $110.00 per exam can be in the form of cash, money order, company cheque or certified personal cheque. Credit card or debit payment is not available. This fee will be non-refundable.
> 
> **For general insurance agent and insurance adjuster exam registrants:**
> 
> The ICM will contact the registrant to arrange the exam date upon receipt of: (1) the Exam Application Form and (2) non-refundable exam fee.  
> 
> For Life and A&S exam registrants: Life and A&S registrants must provide the ORIGINAL LLQP Certificate of Completion or ensure that the ICM receives the Certificate of Completion directly from the LLQP provider in advance of registration for the exam. It is important for the name on the certificate to match the photo identification that the registrant will use to prove his or her identity on the day of the exam. If the name does not match, the registrant will not be permitted to sit the exam.
> 
> The ICM will contact the registrant to arrange the exam date upon receipt of three requirements: (1) the Exam Application Form, (2) LLQP Certificate of Completion, and (3) non-refundable exam fee. The exam must be written within thirty (30) days of receipt of the exam requirements by the ICM.
> 
> Notification of Exam Results: Registrants will be provided with information on how to obtain their individual results and the marks will be available on-line. Additionally confirmation of the exam results will be forwarded via email to the individual. Exam results will not be available by telephone.
> 
> Individuals who have successfully passed the pre-requisite exam(s) may proceed to complete and submit the application for a licence to the ICM. It is important that the applicant answer every question in the application and include all documents required and noted in the checklist, such as a criminal record check, professional liability policy to meet Manitoba requirements, completed Supervision Certificate if a new life agent, and signature of an approved and authorized sponsor.
> 
> Until the application has been approved by the ICM and a licence issued, the applicant is not licensed and cannot act as an agent. Incomplete applications will result in delays; therefore submission of a fully completed application and required documents are to the applicant’s benefit.
