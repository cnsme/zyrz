## About MCC ##

The Medical Council of Canada (MCC) strives to achieve the highest level of medical care for Canadians through excellence in evaluation of physicians. It assesses over 11,000 medical students and graduates every year through its examinations. Its exams are offered in both official languages in sites across Canada, and in the case of the MCCEE, in over 500 locations in 80 countries. The MCC is also a leader in verifying and storing physician credentials, which the candidate can share with medical organizations across Canada. 

The MCC maintains the Canadian Medical Register, in which medical graduates are inscribed when they fulfill the MCC’s requirements. Additionally, the MCC supports research and development to ensure it remains at the forefront of innovation in medical assessment.

## Examination ##

The Medical Council of Canada (MCC) grants a qualification in medicine known as the Licentiate of the Medical Council of Canada (LMCC) to graduate physicians who have satisfied the eligibility requirements and passed the Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination Parts I and II. The MCC registers candidates who have been granted the LMCC in the Canadian Medical Register.

For eligibility to sit the Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination (MCCQE) Part I, graduates of medical schools outside Canada and the United States, referred to on this site as International Medical Graduates (IMGs), as well as graduates from U.S. Schools of Osteopathic Medicine must first pass the Medical Council of Canada Evaluating Examination (MCCEE). IMGs with specialty certification in Canada or the U.S. may be granted an exemption from the MCCEE.

The National Assessment Collaboration (NAC), which reports to the MCC’s Council, offers an examination that tests the knowledge, skills and attitudes essential for entrance into residency training programs. This exam is offered to IMGs through provincial IMG assessment programs

The College of Family Physicians of Canada (CFPC) and the MCC are collaborating on a new and expanded format for the Certification Examination in Family Medicine.

## MCCEE - Medical Council of Canada Evaluating Examination ##

The Medical Council of Canada Evaluating Examination (MCCEE) is a four-hour, computer-based examination offered in both English and French at more than 500 centres in 80 countries worldwide. International medical students or U.S. osteopathic students in the final 20 months of their program and international medical school graduates or U.S. osteopathic graduates must take the MCCEE as a prerequisite for eligibility to the Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examinations.

The MCCEE is a general assessment of the candidate’s basic medical knowledge in the principal disciplines of medicine. It is also designed to assess the skills and knowledge required at the level of a new medical graduate who is about to enter the first year of supervised postgraduate training.

The computer-based MCCEE consists of 180 multiple-choice questions, each listing five possible answers of which only one is the correct or best answer. The MCCEE questions cover the following domains: Child Health, Maternal Health, Adult Health, Mental Health, and Population Health and Ethics. A number of questions in the examination also have a focus on general practice. You can view an example of a multiple-choice question.

### Exam preparation resources ###


**Frequently asked questions**

Candidates are encouraged to review the MCCEE frequently asked questions page.

**Self Administered Evaluating Examination**

The Medical Council of Canada (MCC) offers the Self Administered Evaluating Examination, an online 96 multiple-choice question practice examination intended for international medical graduates and international medical students wishing to test their level of preparedness for the MCCEE. Multiple forms are available at any given time. The Self Administered Evaluating Examination (SAE – EE) does not cover all material in the MCCEE. However, it does provide a sample of the type and style of questions that may be found in the MCCEE and can serve as a study aid. All Self Administered Evaluating Examination (EE 1, EE 2, EE 3, EE 4, EE 5) are all at the same level of difficulty, (e.g., EE 5 is not more difficult than EE 1 or EE 2, etc.). Following completion, feedback is immediately emailed to participants
on the number of correctly answered questions as well as a comparison of their performance to those of other MCCEE participants.


**Objectives for the Qualifying Examination**

Using the Objectives for the Qualifying Examination as a study guide may be helpful for candidates preparing for the MCCEE. Note that the objectives are organized in terms of clinical presentations. Under each clinical presentation is a set of learning objectives that are exactly what  candidates have to know for any of the MCC examinations.

When studying for an examination, candidates should systematically go through each clinical presentation and carefully read the related objectives. If candidates feel that their knowledge or skill related to a given objective is
weak, then they know that this objective needs further study and will require them to consult a medical reference/textbook. MCC test committee members use the clinical presentations and learning objectives listed in this resource when creating test questions.

**MCCEE Online Demo**

NOTICE: Please be advised that the current version of the MCCEE Online Demo is presently being updated and is only intended for information purposes. The latest version will be posted on the MCC website as soon as it is available.

View the MCCEE Online Demo.

The MCCEE Online Demo provides a demonstration of how the computer-based Evaluating Examination operates. Candidates will be able to view a series of screens to familiarize themselves with the computer testing environment. This will give candidates an opportunity to learn about each feature before using it in the actual examination. They will be instructed on how to use the mouse and the different parts of the screen.

The MCCEE Online Demo includes 10 sample questions. The correct answers are not provided and answers to these questions will not be scored. The last screen of the sample test shows the Item Reviewing feature
that replicates what will be seen on the actual examination. The Item Reviewing feature has not been activated for the MCCEE Online Demo and is only shown as an example of the Item Reviewing screen.

**Multiple-choice question examples**

A free demonstration of the Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination Part I can be taken online and contains similar multiple-choice questions to those on the MCCEE.

**Transition to DSM-5**

In May 2013 the American Psychiatric Association published the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).

Over 2014 and 2015, the MCCEE computer-based questions will be updated to include the new DSM-5 language. These updated questions will still include the DSM-IV-TR language, which will be featured in brackets after the DSM-5 terminology.

We expect that the first MCCEE administration to include updated questions will be the November 2014 session.

For more information, please visit Medical Council of Canada transition to DSM-5.

**Reference books**

The MCC has compiled a [list of reference books](http://mcc.ca/examinations/list-of-suggested-reference-books/) that may be helpful in preparing for the examination.


http://mcc.ca/examinations/mccee/scoring/

### Scoring ###

The Medical Council of Canada Evaluating Examination (MCCEE) is a four-hour computer-based examination consisting of 180 multiple-choice questions. Of these 180 questions, 150 are scored questions and 30 are non-scored questions.

The 30 non-scored questions are included for quality assurance and/or research purposes, as well as to monitor the performance of the overall examination or specific test questions. While the non-scored questions do not count toward the final score or final result, they are not identified as non-scored questions. Candidates are encouraged to do as well as they can on every question.

Test questions are calibrated on an ability scale resulting in a difficulty being assigned to each question.The determination of each candidate’s final score and pass/fail result take into account the question difficulty, as well as whether or not the candidate answered the question correctly. Points are not deducted for incorrect answers. Therefore, it is always advantageous to make a “best guess” even when uncertain of an answer.

MCC examination scores are reported in a standard-score format, which are distributions scaled to have a predetermined mean and/or standard deviation. A candidate’s pass/fail result is based on where his or her standard score falls in relation to the pass/fail mark established for the examination. A candidate’s performance is judged in relation to the pass score for the examination and not judged on how well other individuals have performed on the examination. Candidates can, however, compare their performance to other candidates because standard scores also provide information on where a candidate stands in relation to other candidates.

The MCCEE results are reported on a standard-score scale that ranges from 50 to 500. The scores are reported on a scale on which the mean or average score is approximately 271, the standard deviation is 50, and the pass mark is always 250. Due to the nature of the examination and the different difficulty for each question, results are not presented as a percentage. The MCCEE scores can be interpreted in relation to the mean MCCEE score. For example, a score of 321 is one standard deviation above the mean score of 271 (271 + 50). A score of 371 is two standard deviations above the mean score of 271 (271 + (2*50)). The distance from the mean MCCEE score of 271 indicates, in general, how performance for one candidate relates to other candidates that have taken the same examination.

In addition to providing candidates with their final score, the MCC provides supplemental feedback on candidates’ examination performance. The MCC has prepared a help file to assist candidates in interpreting their MCCEE supplemental feedback report.

Note that the MCCEE was scored differently prior to 2007. Candidates who took the examination prior to 2007 would have had their scores established and reported differently than those of current candidates. As such, scores obtained prior to 2007 should not be compared to those obtained after this period. For more information, please contact us.

### Results ###


**Release of results**

Approximately seven weeks after the last day of the examination session, candidates will receive an email notification stating that they can verify their pass/fail result through their physiciansapply.ca accounts. The Statement of Results and the supplemental feedback report will be posted in candidates’ physiciansapply.ca accounts shortly thereafter. In order to prevent errors or fraud and for reasons of confidentiality, results cannot be given over the phone, by fax or by email.

**How results are communicated**

The Medical Council of Canada (MCC) issues candidates a Statement of Results through their physiciansapply.ca account. The Statement of Results includes the candidate’s final result and total score as well as the score that was required to pass the examination. The MCC also provides supplemental feedback on candidates’ examination performance through their physiciansapply.ca accounts. The MCC has also prepared a help file to assist candidates in interpreting their MCCEE supplemental feedback report.
Candidates applying to an organization that requires submission of certified copies of the Statement of Results or the supplemental feedback report can request that the MCC send certified copies. There is an administrative fee for this service.

**Fails**

The MCC does not limit the number of times a candidate may attempt the MCCEE. However, candidates with a pass result on the MCCEE cannot retake the examination in an attempt to obtain a higher score.

**Rescore requests**

Only candidates who have failed the MCCEE can request a rescoring of their examination; candidates with a pass result are not eligible for the rescoring service. Requests for a rescoring from candidates who failed the examination will be accepted up to three months following the date of the examination, upon receipt of a written request and a credit card payment of the applicable fee.

To request a rescore, see Rescoring by the MCC.

After the examination, final results are verified at least three times before being sent to candidates. Borderline results (i.e., those within a close range of the passing score) undergo increased review.

Given the additional scrutiny that the MCC gives to borderline results, it is unlikely that rescoring the examination will produce a change in result. Three potential outcomes can occur as a result of the rescoring of the examination: no change in score, change in score but no change in the fail result, or change in score and change in fail to pass result. If the rescoring produces a change in score or a change in final result and score, the MCC will issue a new Statement of Results and supplemental feedback report to the candidate through his or her physiciansapply.ca account.


**Appeals**

Any MCCEE candidate who has been denied standing, including any denial of entry to future examinations, or who considers that the results of an examination have been prejudiced by the conduct of the examination may appeal to the Central Examination Committee. Candidates cannot seek to appeal the content on the examination.

Any candidate wishing to launch an appeal must notify the Executive Director in writing within 45 days of the decision of the Evaluating Examination Composite Committee. For more information on the appeal process for the MCCEE, please review the guidelines for appeal.

**Validity period of the MCCEE pass result**

In November 2005, the policy that limited the validity period of the MCCEE pass result to five years was abolished. Therefore, there are no longer any restrictions on a candidate’s pass result on the MCCEE. The expiry date on the MCCEE result letters issued prior to November 2005 no longer applies. This policy change applies only to candidates whose last MCCEE status is a pass result, regardless of when and how long ago the examination was taken.

The Canadian regulatory and educational bodies have been advised of this change and have access to candidates’ examination result history and current status. MCCEE result letters that refer to the five-year validity period will not be re-issued.

## National Assessment Collaboration ##

The National Assessment Collaboration (NAC) is an alliance of Canadian organizations streamlining the evaluation process for international medical graduates (IMGs) seeking a licence to practise medicine in Canada.

The NAC examination assesses the readiness of an IMG for entrance into a Canadian residency program. It is a national, standardized examination that tests the knowledge, skills and attitudes essential for entrance into postgraduate training in Canada.

Comprising a series of clinical stations, the NAC examination presents typical clinical scenarios. The examination may include, but is not limited to, problems in medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics, gynecology, psychiatry and surgery.

Achieving a pass standing on this examination does not guarantee a training position in Canada. However, candidates receive feedback on their strengths and weaknesses as assessed in the examination. Candidates can then choose to share this information with program directors as part of their application to residency training programs.

All NAC examination candidates are, at a minimum, required to have passed the Medical Council of Canada Evaluating Examination (MCCEE) before being eligible to take the NAC examination. Some jurisdictions may add region-specific criteria.

The Canadian Resident Matching Service (CaRMS) accepts NAC examination results as part of match application packages. Please contact CaRMS for further information on its match application requirements.

The NAC examination is not a prerequisite to obtain the Licentiate of the Medical Council of Canada. However, depending on the provincial IMG assessment program, a pass result on the NAC examination may be a prerequisite for eligibility for residency training programs.


The NAC examination can be taken at any of the examination sites and will be accepted by residency program directors regardless of where it was taken. Candidates do not have to take the examination in the province in which they will apply for residency.

For information regarding centre assignment, please visit the Centre selection page.

**Fees**

The Medical Council of Canada and the provincial programs offering the examination have worked together to establish a national fee which will apply to NAC examinations. For more information on the NAC examination fee, please visit the Examination and Service Fees page.

**Application to future NAC examination sessions**

To receive a notice when registration opens for future examination sessions, submit your email address below. The MCC will send this notification to your email address and not through your physiciansapply.ca account. The MCC cannot guarantee that the email notification will reach your inbox.

### Application and eligibility ###

**Eligibility**

**Requirements for first-time applicants**

- Candidates must be a/an:
  - International medical graduate;
  - International medical student;
  - Graduate of a U.S. School of Osteopathic Medicine; or
  - Student of a U.S. School of Osteopathic Medicine.
- Candidates must also have passed the Medical Council of Canada Evaluating Examination (MCCEE)
  - Candidates need to take the MCCEE first to determine whether they have the basic medical knowledge for the NAC exam.
  - This requirement ensures that only those who are most likely to have success incur the expenses related to taking the NAC exam in Canada.
    - Students
        - Candidates are not required to resubmit a Student Attestation Form if they already did so when applying for the MCCEE.
            - However, if there are changes since submitting the Student Attestation Form, another form will be required reflecting the changes.
    - Graduates
        - Candidates who graduated since applying for the MCCEE must create a source verification request (SVR) for their diploma/degree through their physiciansapply.ca account and submit a copy of their diploma/degree.

**Requirements for repeat applicants**

- The NAC examination can only be taken once per calendar year.
- The NAC examination can be taken a maximum of three times (effective 2011).
- Eligible candidates who have a pass standing on the NAC examination (most recent result) will not be eligible to retake the examination (effective 2015).
- In the event of a fail standing in 2011 or later, eligible candidates can attempt the examination once per calendar year, to a maximum of three attempts.
- A candidate’s most recent result remains valid indefinitely (no longer expires). If a candidate takes the examination more than once, the most recent result will be the valid result.

**Application to the NAC examination**


- Candidates can apply for the NAC through their physiciansapply.ca account only during specific application periods indicated under Examination at a glance.
- Please note that the option to apply to the examination will only appear in the candidate’s account during specific application periods and only if the candidate meets all eligibility requirements.

**Processing of your application**

Please allow up to three weeks for the processing of your application.

- If the system determines that all documentation required to confirm your examination eligibility has already been reviewed and accepted by the MCC, you may quickly receive another communication confirming acceptance of your examination application.

**Timing of MCCEE and NAC examination for candidates seeking a residency position on July 1, 2016**

1. Candidates graduating in spring 2016 will be able to apply for the MCCEE 20 months before their graduation date, i.e. as of fall 2014. Previously, the requirement was for students to take the MCCEE in the final 12 months of their medical school program. The change from 12 months to 20 months was made to enable international medical students to challenge both the MCCEE and the NAC examination prior to the CaRMS deadline.
1. Once their application to the MCCEE is accepted, these candidates must take the MCCEE by the March 2015 session. The March 2015 session is the last possible chance for candidates to take the MCCEE if they also wish to take the NAC examination prior to the 2016 CaRMS R-1 Match.
1. Candidates who have taken the MCCEE in March 2015 or earlier and who have received a pass result can apply for the September 2015 NAC examination in spring 2015.
1. Results from the September 2015 NAC examination will be provided in time for the CaRMS application process for the 2016 R-1 Residency Match.

### Centre selection ###

**Centre selection**

- When applying for the National Assessment Collaboration (NAC) examination online, you can choose three examination centres in order of preference. The MCC will make every attempt to accommodate your exam centre preference. The likelihood of being assigned to a particular centre does not improve if you choose only one centre.
- The NAC exam is offered both in French and in English only at the Montreal centre and is identified as Montreal (EN/FR). At time of registration, you must designate in which language you want to take the exam at the Montreal exam site.
- The NAC examination can be taken at any of the examination sites and will be accepted by residency program directors regardless of where it was taken. Candidates do not have to take the examination in the province in which they will apply for residency.

**Centre assignment**

- A message will be sent by early July to all accepted candidates once the examination centres have been assigned. This message will explain how to view your centre assignment through your account.
- Approximately two weeks following centre assignment, a message will be sent to all candidates informing them that their entrance card package is now available through their account, and instructions on how to view and print the entrance card package will be provided in this message.
- In collaboration with IMG partner programs, the Medical Council of Canada (MCC) makes every effort to accommodate candidates’ centre choices; however, the MCC cannot guarantee assignment to your preferred centre.
- Once you have chosen your centres during the online application, you must indicate whether or not you would accept assignment to another centre in the event that the MCC cannot assign you to one of your centre choices:
  - If you indicated, during the online application, that you did not wish to consider other centres, and the MCC cannot assign you to one of your centres, your application will be withdrawn and the refundable portion of the NAC examination fee paid (i.e., the examination fee minus the withdrawal examination fee) will be credited to your account.
  - If you indicated, during the online application, that you would accept assignment to other centers, you will be assigned to the nearest available centre.
- Once a centre has been assigned, a request for a change of examination centre for the September 2015 session will be considered only if received by Thursday, July 23, 2015.

**Scheduling conflict (centre assignment)**

If you have a significant conflict with respect to your centre assignment, you must send a message through your account, accompanied by supporting documentation. If the request is approved, a centre change fee will apply.

http://mcc.ca/examinations/nac-overview/osce-station-therapeutics-descriptions/

### OSCE station description ###



The National Assessment Collaboration (NAC) examination consists of a series of stations based on presentations of clinical scenarios. For a given administration, each candidate rotates through the same series of stations including pilot stations that do not count towards a candidate’s final score. Each station is 11 minutes in length with two minutes between stations. Note: As of 2014,Therapeutic knowledge will be assessed within the OSCE portion of the examination. There is no longer a written component to this exam.

At each station, a brief written statement introduces a clinical problem and outlines the candidate’s tasks (e.g. take a history, perform a physical examination, etc.). In each station, there is at least one standardized patient and a physician examiner. A standardized patient is either a healthy person or a person with chronic stable findings who has been trained to present a real patient’s signs and/or symptoms in a reliable and consistent manner. Candidates should interact with standardized patients as they would with their own patients. This includes draping a patient as appropriate for different elements of a physical examination (regardless of their gender). Most standardized patients that are to be physically examined are already in hospital gowns, but the gowns may be removed as part of the examination. Interacting with standardized patients also includes questioning them and responding to their problems, as you would with a real patient. Your interaction with the standardized patient is part of what the physician examiner is assessing.

In general, you will not interact with the physician examiner. An examiner may prompt you once if he or she believes that you have misunderstood the directions; e.g., you are pursuing a history during the physical examination station. They may also intervene if they believe there is a problem for the standardized patient.

The physician examiner observes the patient encounter. For most stations, the candidate will be asked to respond to a series of standardized oral questions asked by the physician examiner after eight minutes with the standardized patient. The candidate instructions (posted on the door and in the room) will indicate whether there are physician examiner oral questions at the eight-minute mark or not.

It is not your ability to do and be all things at each station that contributes to a good assessment; it is your ability to focus on the assigned task, as well as the given patient problem. For example, if you are asked to conduct a focused physical examination on a patient with acute onset of shortness of breath, the challenge is to prioritize, organize and conduct a physical examination that is appropriate to the degree of respiratory distress presented by the standardized patient in the time allowed for the station. The ability to decide what is necessary for a patient problem, given limited information and time, is critical to success on the examination.

Physician examiners may intervene to provide you with information or results. For instance, in a physical examination station, a physician examiner may be directed to give a blood pressure reading or results of an ophthalmoscopic examination. They can only do this if they are so instructed by the scoring instruments and only if you have initiated the examination maneuver. The intention is to save you time by allowing you to move on to other sections of the physical examination.

Similarly, physician examiners may provide results for some tests. This only occurs at those stations where you are expected to order tests or investigations. However, results are not given for all the tests or investigations that are ordered. This point is important, as ordering a certain laboratory investigation may be a correct procedure, even if no results are forthcoming.

In some administrations there may be observers or second examiners. These individuals are introduced as part of the quality assurance process and for ongoing assessment.

http://mcc.ca/examinations/nac-overview/exam-day/

### Exam Day ###

**Equipment**

You must bring with you to the examination:

- Plain white lab coat without a university or hospital crest
- Stethoscope
- Reflex hammer

The equipment must be carried in lab coat pockets, as no bags will be allowed.

NOTE: All personal belongings will be collected at registration (e.g., keys, papers, pens and pencils, wallets, cell phones, PDAs, as well as coats) and stored until after the examination. While every effort will be made to store your belongings safely, the Medical Council of Canada (MCC) is not responsible for these belongings and you are encouraged to bring as few personal belongings as possible.

You will be provided pencils (with erasers) at the site. You will be required to use the pencils (with erasers) provided at the site.


**Registration and orientation**

If you are more than 15 minutes late for registration, you may be denied entry to the examination.

Immediately following registration on examination day, you will attend an orientation to the examination. The orientation provides you with the logistical details of the examination and an opportunity to ask questions. Each examination site is staffed to ensure that you are guided through the examination.

Once a candidate chooses to begin the examination, it will count as an attempt even if he/she cannot finish.

**Examination security**

No talking between candidates is permitted:
Once the OSCE has begun, up until sequestering
Between stations (except with site staff)
All electronic devices are not permitted (including smartwatches)
Access to communication devices, including telephones or cell phones, during the exam and sequestering is not permitted
Breaking the rules may result in dismissal from the examination, may invalidate your results and you may be barred from taking future MCC examinations.

**Candidate identification**

Candidate identification numbers are printed on bar code labels that are distributed to you at registration. You are asked to give a label to the physician examiners as you proceed from station to station. The physician examiners, in turn, attach the label to your scoring instruments. In addition, you are required to wear a photographic identification badge, which also indicates your ID number and start location number.

**Candidate notebooks**

The MCC provides a small notebook that you may use for writing notes while taking the examination. Only one notebook will be provided and no pages can be added. The notes in the notebook will not be scored. Your ID label is attached to the notebook cover. This booklet must be returned intact at the checkout (including unused labels), i.e., no pages or parts can be torn or ripped out.


**Complaints and conflict of interest**


A candidate who believes that administrative, environmental or personal health problems encountered during the course of an examination session may significantly affect his/her results must:

- Immediately communicate such concerns to the Chief Examiner on site at the time of the examination session in question
- Complete an incident report at the exam centre as soon as possible after the incident
- Submit a message through your account detailing the incident within one week following the examination

Any intervention, if appropriate, is possible only if notice of the concern/problem is presented by the candidate in this manner. Concerns relating to exam day occurrences cannot be investigated after this deadline including once results have been released.

If you have concerns about a potential conflict of interest prior to the examination, you are strongly encouraged to contact the MCC before exam day. If, during the examination, you encounter an examiner or standardized patient where a conflict exists, you should:

- Exit the station and inform the staff immediately (once staff are notified, they will make alternate arrangements for the administration of the specific station for you)
- Submit a message through your account informing the MCC of the occurrence within one week of the examination

The MCC takes the view that a conflict of interest exists, without limitation, in situations where the examiner or standardized patient is (i) related by blood or marriage to the candidate; (ii) is or has been in a significant business or social relationship with the candidate, or is a professional colleague; or (iii) where a conflict of interest relating to the candidate and such examiner or standardized patient has been previously identified (e.g., there is an outstanding complaint in another context). Please note that knowing or being known to an examiner or standardized patient is not generally deemed a conflict of interest.

**Discontinuation of examination**


All candidates who choose to discontinue the examination will be asked to sign a standard waiver form on exam day.

**Navigating the examination and duration**


Remember that there is an orientation at the examination site on the day itself. Signs will be posted and a considerable effort is made to allow you to focus on your performance, not on finding the next room. Staff will always be nearby to provide directions. If in doubt, ask the nearest staff person for directions.

The examination includes registration of candidates, an orientation session and sometimes a sequestering period for a total time of approximately six and a half to seven hours. Of the total time, the OSCE is approximately three hours in length.

**Eleven-minute stations**

In OSCE stations, you may be required to:

- Obtain a history and/or conduct a physical examination
- Address patient concerns regarding results, a diagnosis or a medical problem
- Manage a patient problem in a family practice clinic or in an Emergency Department setting

If you finish the patient encounter early, you must wait quietly. If you remember something more that you would like to do, you may re-engage the patient at any time until the warning bell/announcement or final 11-minute buzzer/announcement depending on the station. After the oral questions begin, you may not return to the patient encounter, even if there is time remaining before the end of the station. After the final bell sounds, you must leave the station and move to the next one. You may not leave early.

You are not expected to carry out genital or rectal examinations. This is out of respect for the standardized patients and the short time allotted to each station. In a station where you believe that such an examination is appropriate, you should inform the physician examiner. If there are relevant findings needed to complete the clinical encounter, or answer the oral questions, the physician examiner will provide these findings to you.

Although it is always expected that candidates will interact directly with the standardized patients (asking questions directly, conducting a physical examination, explaining a prescription), physical examination stations require a somewhat different strategy. While conducting a physical examination, you should state briefly what you are doing and report your findings. This is critical to receiving full credit. For instance, a physician examiner cannot give credit for observing the patient unless you state that you are observing the patient. If there are findings; for example, pallor, then report this to the examiner to indicate that you have noted it. If you observe that there are no positive findings, then you can just report “Normal”. A physician examiner is not allowed to assume, for example, that a candidate is looking for pallor, inflammation, skin rashes. Likewise, credit for findings (positive or negative) cannot be given unless you report what you found.

**Moving from station to station**

A set amount of time is allowed for moving to the next station and for reading the posted instructions. During this time, the physician examiner completes the rating instrument for the current candidate and prepares for the next candidate. Remove one bar code identification label from the sheet, so it is ready to give to the physician examiner. At the sound of the buzzer, you enter the room and proceed with the required task.

**Candidate instructions**

Read the instructions for each station carefully. For instance, in a physical examination station, you must greet the patient and report what you are doing and report your findings (to both the patient and the physician examiner) as you carry out those examination manoeuvers that you deem appropriate. It is not appropriate to ask questions to the patient during a physical examination station unless the questions relate directly to the examination itself; for example, “Does it hurt when you raise your arm?” Patients are discouraged from answering other questions in any detail. There is no credit given for asking questions and doing so will use some of the limited time available for that station. Conversely, it is not appropriate to carry out any physical examination manoeuvers in a history station.

In a combined history/physical examination station or a management station (i.e., doing whatever tasks are necessary to manage the patient’s problem at that moment), it is up to you to prioritize the elements of the two (or more) tasks.

The instructions for each station are posted next to the door and are available inside each room. The instructions provide the patient’s name and age, the presenting problem, the setting (family practice clinic or Emergency Department), and the nature of the station, be it a history and/or physical. Vital signs, test results and/or elements of the family history may be provided. You are allowed to take notes while waiting to enter a station.

The following is an example of instructions to candidates for a clinical station:

Jonathan Jones, a 65-year-old man, presents to your office because he has been experiencing abdominal pain.

- IN THE NEXT 8 MINUTES:
CONDUCT A FOCUSED AND RELEVANT PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

- As you proceed with the physical examination,
EXPLAIN TO THE EXAMINER what you are doing and DESCRIBE ANY FINDINGS.

- After the 8-minute warning buzzer, the examiner will ask you some questions related to this patient.

- GIVE ONE LABEL TO THE EXAMINER

A key word in the instructions is FOCUSED. You are expected to conduct a physical examination relevant to assessing abdominal pain. There is no requirement (and no marks are given) for obtaining a history, only for the manner of the physical examination and for the specific manoeuvers that are performed.

**Confidentiality of examination materials or content**

As part of the exam process, you agree not to disseminate or reveal to others the examination materials and content. This means that you cannot discuss or disclose exam content (including patient portrayals and findings, oral questions, cases, etc.) at any time in any way even after the examination ends.

Examples of breaches in confidentiality include, but are not limited to, comparing patient responses with your colleagues, sharing content with future exam candidates and posting information online.

The MCC actively monitors for breaches in confidentiality, and will seek disciplinary and legal measures against candidates who disclose examination content. Agreeing to maintain confidentiality and then breaking that confidentiality by disseminating exam content is considered a highly unprofessional act.

Breaking confidentiality and disseminating exam content can lead to candidates being denied a standing on the examination and being reported to regulatory authorities and to other medical organizations, and being barred from taking MCC exams in the future.

### Exam preparation resources ###

The National Assessment Collaboration (NAC) examination assesses the competence of international medical graduate candidates; specifically, the knowledge, skills and attitudes essential for entrance into postgraduate training in Canada. The following resources will aid candidates in preparing for the NAC examination.

**Examination day**



The duration of the examination itself is approximately three hours. However, candidates should anticipate six and a half to seven hours for the administration of the exam. For security reasons, candidates in certain cities may be required to arrive at a designated time prior to the examination and remain on site until a designated time following the examination. Specific instructions will be provided with the registration package prior to the examination date.

All candidates are required to function in a simulated clinical situation and must bring with them a plain white lab coat, a stethoscope and a reflex hammer. For a complete overview of the NAC examination regulations, candidates are encouraged to review the guidelines to follow on the day of the examination.


**Medical Council of Canada (MCC) reference documents**


NAC examination candidates are encouraged to review common mistakes made on objective structured clinical examination stations.

**Objectives for the Qualifying Examination**


Using the Objectives for the Qualifying Examination as a study guide may be helpful for candidates taking the NAC examination. The Objectives serve as the basis for the Medical Council of Canada Evaluating Examination (MCCEE) and the Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination (MCCQE) Part I and Part II. These Objectives also serve as a general overview of possible test material that may appear on the NAC examination. Note that the Objectives are organized in terms of clinical presentations.

**Transition to DSM-5**

In May 2013 the American Psychiatric Association published the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).

Over 2014 and 2015, the MCCEE computer-based questions will be updated to include the new DSM-5 language. These updated questions will still include the DSM-IV-TR language, which will be featured in brackets after the DSM-5 terminology.

Candidates answering questions asked by the physician examiner can use either DSM-5 or DSM-IV-TR language where appropriate.

For more information, please visit Medical Council of Canada transition to DSM-5.

**Reference books**


Prior to the examination, individuals who are unfamiliar with disease management practices in North America may wish to consult Therapeutic Choices edited by Jean Gray, published by the Canadian Pharmacists Association, as a source of general information.

**General IMG information** 

IMGs can also visit our Overview of the process of obtaining a licence to practise medicine for IMGs page for general information on beginning the process of obtaining a licence to practise medicine in Canada.


http://mcc.ca/examinations/nac-overview/scoring/

### Scoring ###

**Overview**

Objectivity on the NAC examination is achieved through the use of standardized guidelines for the administration, the training of physician examiners and standardized patients, and the use of predetermined scoring instruments. The OSCE component is evaluated by physician examiners based on the candidate’s performance at each station.

To pass the National Assessment Collaboration exam, a candidate must achieve an overall score that is set at the standard of a graduating student from a Canadian medical school. In awarding the final result on the examination, the NAC Examination Committee also considers any physician examiner observations on the candidate’s ability to demonstrate the appropriate ethical and professional behaviour.

**How are OSCE stations scored on the NAC exam?**



Physician examiners observe candidates interacting with standardized patients and provide ratings on up to nine competencies relevant to the presenting problem and clinical task. These competencies are history taking, physical examination, organization skills, communication skills, language fluency, diagnosis, data interpretation, investigations, therapeutics and management. The OSCE station score is the average of a physician examiner’s competency ratings. A candidate’s score on the OSCE is the average of the station scores.

**How are NAC scores reported?**


NAC exam scores are reported on a scale with a distribution ranging from 0 to 100. The pass score is based on a performance equivalent to a graduating student from a Canadian medical school. A candidate’s performance is judged in relation to the exam pass score and not judged on how well other individuals have performed.

In addition to the total score, candidates are also provided with supplemental feedback on their exam performance. This report consists of a graphical display of the candidate’s performance on the competencies assessed.

Since competency scores are based on few observations, they do not have the same precision as the total score.

**New in 2015 – Changes to the supplemental feedback report**

Candidates from previous sessions may recall that their report contained a table with stations listed from high performance to low performance. As of 2015, the MCC has removed this table from the supplemental feedback report as the information it contained, while correct, could be misinterpreted and/or misleading.

The table provided a rank order of stations, but candidate performance in some cases was equal, close to equal, or not equidistant across all stations. As a result of this change, in 2015 the report will be one page instead of two.

### Results ###

**Release of results**


Important: Results will be available in your physiciansapply.ca account, 6 to 8 weeks after the date of your exam. Therefore, candidates who took the exam on Sept. 12 or Sept. 13 might receive results prior to candidates taking the examination on Sept. 19 or Sept. 20.

Examination results are confirmed by the National Assessment Collaboration (NAC) Examination Committee and are released by the Medical Council of Canada (MCC) through physiciansapply.ca six to eight weeks after the examination date. The MCC also provides supplemental feedback on candidates’ examination performance through their physiciansapply.ca account. Candidates will be able to share their results with the Canadian Resident Matching Service (CaRMS) and other organizations registered with physiciansapply.ca. For reasons of confidentiality, results cannot be given verbally, by fax or by email.

**Validity period of a pass result on the NAC examination**

A candidate’s most recent result remains valid indefinitely (no longer expires). If a candidate takes the NAC examination more than once, the most recent result will be the only valid result.

**Retaking the examination**


The NAC examination can be attempted once per calendar year and can be taken a maximum of three times (effective from 2011). Eligible candidates who have a pass standing on the NAC examination (most recent result) will not be eligible to retake the exam (effective from 2015).

**Rescore requests**

Only candidates who have failed the NAC examination can request a rescoring of their examination; candidates with a pass result are not eligible for the rescoring service. Please note that scores are verified several times before results are released. Candidates who wish to have their examination rescored must:

- Submit a message through your account within one month of the results release date indicated on the Statement of Results. The request should include an explanation for the rescore request, the candidate’s name, MCC candidate code, address and phone number.
- Accompany the written request with payment of the applicable fee by credit card (Visa or MasterCard). Fees are refunded if a rescore procedure leads to a score or status change.

A rescore includes the following steps:

- Authentication of all parts of your examination, including a complete file review (incident reports and physician comments)
- Verification of the computer-scanned answer sheets for anomalies (torn sheets, stray marks, ink marks, etc.).
- Verification of raw computer data against physician-completed answer sheets.
- Verification of the computer file scores against those reported in the result letter

A rescore does NOT include a re-evaluation of the candidate’s performance by additional examiners.

Rescores are processed within four to six weeks from the date they are received. Please note that the new score could be higher, lower or the same as the original score received.

### Information for residency program directors ###


The National Assessment Collaboration (NAC) examination assesses the readiness of an international medical graduate (IMG) for entrance into a Canadian residency program. It is a pan-Canadian, standardized examination that provides residency program directors with objective information on the skills, attitudes and knowledge level of IMGs applying for postgraduate training in Canada.

It is developed by the NAC Examination Committee, a group of physicians and medical educators from across the country with expertise in assessment and clinical content.

**Background and rationale**

Prior to the creation of the NAC examination, a number of provinces developed and delivered individual clinical examinations to assess IMGs. The NAC examination was developed to reduce duplication between provincial IMG assessment programs and offer standardized results to Canadian residency program directors across the country. The exam results provide residency program directors with a comprehensive assessment of an IMG’s skills, attitudes, knowledge and readiness at the level of a recent Canadian medical graduate for entry into postgraduate training. This information can be used in concert with other information – such as a residency application letter or results from the Medical Council of Canada Evaluating Examination (MCCEE) – to obtain a comprehensive view of an applicant’s skill set.

**Scope  and format**

The NAC examination is a clinical evaluation that consists of up to 12 different 11-minute clinical stations, each with a standardized patient and a physician examiner.

In total, the duration of the exam is approximately 2.5 hours. However, the candidate may be on site for a longer period of time for administrative reasons.

Visit our OSCE station page for more detailed information on the format of the NAC examination.

**Evaluation and scoring**

The pass/fail result is based on whether a candidates’ examination score is equal or higher than the pass score established for the NAC examination. The standard is based on the level of performance compared to a graduate from a Canadian medical school. The NAC examination also collects information from physician examiners on the candidate’s ability to demonstrate ethical and professional behaviour.

**OSCE component scoring**

Candidates are rated by physician examiners on up to nine different competencies per station. These competencies include:


- History taking	
- Communication skills	
- Data interpretation
- Physical examination	
- Language fluency	
- Investigations
- Organizational skills	
- Diagnosis	
- Therapeutics and Management

A candidate’s score for each station is the average of all competency ratings measured on the station. A candidate’s score for the entire OSCE is the average of the station scores.

In awarding the final result on the examination, consideration is given to any observations made by the physician examiner at each of the stations regarding the candidate’s ability to demonstrate the ethical and professional behaviour needed to enter postgraduate training.

More detailed information on NAC examination scoring can be found on the Scoring page.

**Content development**

Content for the NAC examination is developed by the NAC Examination Committee – a group of physicians from across the country with expertise in multiple medical disciplines. The Examination Committee meets on a regular basis to develop and review content and set standards based on the expected performance of a graduate from a Canadian medical school.

Learn more about the NAC Examination Committee.

**Testing locations**

The NAC examination is currently delivered through provincial IMG assessment programs in Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Quebec.

http://mcc.ca/examinations/mccqe-part-i/scheduling/


### Scheduling ###

**Selecting a centre**

- During the online application process, you must select up to three examination centres, in order of preference
- The likelihood of being assigned to a particular centre does not improve if you choose only one centre
- The Medical Council of Canada (MCC) makes every effort to provide you with a space at one of your requested centres; however, it cannot guarantee your assignment to one of these centres

**Confirmation of centre assignment**

- Once MCC staff has assigned centres for all accepted candidates, by the end of February, candidates will be sent a communication to confirm their centre assignment information online
- A notice will also be posted on the MCC website
- Approximately two weeks following the designated scheduling period, a message will be sent to all candidates informing them that their Entrance card package is now available through their account; instructions on how to view and print the entrance card package will also be provided in this message


**Scheduling the examination date online**

The MCC cannot guarantee that you will be able to schedule your examination on a specific day within the examination period.

- You will be required to schedule your examination date through your account during the designated MCCQE Part I scheduling period
- Each centre has restrictions based on the size of its computer lab and the number of days it can provide the examination
- Even if your assigned centre is only running for one day, you must schedule your examination date online in order to obtain your Personal Identification Number (PIN), which is required to log onto the computer on examination day
- If you do not schedule your examination date during the designated MCCQE Part I Scheduling period, an MCC staff member will manually assign you to one of the remaining available days at your assigned centre

**Request for scheduling**

- In the event of a significant conflict (for example, another examination, overseas travel restrictions, etc.), a candidate may request consideration, in advance of the designated MCCQE Part I scheduling period, to not be scheduled on a specific day
- You cannot ‘change’ examination sessions. If you are assigned a centre, date and time to take the examination in the spring session, and wish to delay taking the examination until the following fall session or beyond, you will need to withdraw your application (the withdrawal administration fee will apply), and reapply when you wish to take the examination
- Notice of such a conflict, with supporting documentation and payment of the pre-scheduling fee, should be submitted once confirmation of centre assignment is obtained and the dates available at each of the centres are known

**Examination date changes after centre assignmet**

Deadlines, fees, procedure for centre change requests:

After you have been assigned to a centre, a request for a centre change (within the session you applied for) will be considered, provided that a written request is submitted to the MCC by Tuesday, March 22, 2016 and space is available at the requested centre
A centre change fee will apply if the requested change can be accommodated
When submitting a centre change request, you should keep in mind that if the MCCQE Part I scheduling period has already begun or has ended, the dates available at the requested centre will likely be very limited

**Examination date changes after the date has been scheduled**

Deadlines, fees, procedure for date change requests:

A request for a date change will be considered provided that a written request is submitted to the MCC no later than Tuesday, March 22, 2016 and space is available on the requested date
A date change fee will apply if the requested change can be accommodated
If a centre change is required to accommodate the requested date change (and only if you approve this change), only the centre change fee will apply

http://mcc.ca/examinations/mccqe-part-i/language-quality-assurance/

### Language quality assurance ###

The Medical Council of Canada (MCC) produces examination content in both official languages (English/French). It follows a comprehensive quality assurance process to ensure that examination content, whether in English or French, is of the highest quality.

**Content development**

MCC examination content is developed by the MCC’s test committees, made up of physicians from across Canada who are experts in their fields. The test committees include representation from both official language groups (English and French).

**Translation process**

Examination questions are initially created in English by the test committees. The MCC then sends the questions to professional translators who have medical terminology translation expertise. Once the translation is complete, the following quality assurance steps are taken and content revisions made as required:

1. MCC in-house editors perform multiple comparative reads (comparing English questions to French translations).
1. A Francophone test committee member performs another set of comparative reviews, which includes reading the content out loud.
1. Francophone specialist physicians from French faculties of medicine participate in another round of comparative readings. Each French examination question is reviewed by two to three Francophone physicians during these sessions.

**Candidate input**

The MCC encourages candidates taking the examination to report any content that may be ambiguous or confusing. Candidates can also make comments in the “notes” section attached to each exam question. All candidate reports and comments about the quality of the content are reviewed by the committee prior to scoring the examination.

**Question analysis**

New content, whether in English or in French, is piloted before it is used as active content on the examination. Pilot questions do not count toward the candidate’s score. The MCC analyzes candidates’ response patterns after the examination. Any question that does not perform as expected is returned to the committee for review and revision, and is later re-piloted.

Should an active question not meet expected performance requirements, it is also flagged for review by the committee prior to scoring the examination. If it is determined that an error or flaw in the question could have affected performance, it will not count toward the candidates’ score.

http://mcc.ca/examinations/mccqe-part-i/exam-preparation-resources/

### Exam preparation resources ###

**Self-Administered Qualifying Examination Part I**

The Medical Council of Canada (MCC) offers the Self Administered Qualifying Examination Part I (SAE – QEI), an online, 96 multiple-choice question practice examination intended for individuals wishing to test their level of preparedness for the Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination Part I (MCCQE Part I). Multiple forms are available at any given time. The Self Administered Qualifying Examination Part I does not cover all material in the MCCQE Part I and is not meant to take the place of the MCCQE Part I. However, it does provide a sample of the type and style of questions that may be found in the MCCQE Part I and can serve as a study aid. All Self Administered Qualifying Examinations for Part I (QEI 1, QEI 2, QEI 3) are all at the same level of difficulty (e.g., QEI 3 is not more difficult than QEI 1 or QEI 2). Following completion, feedback is immediately e-mailed to participants on the number of correctly answered questions as well as a comparison of their performance to those of other MCCQE Part I participants.

Please note that unlike the MCCQE Part I examination, the SAE – QEI does not contain a clinical decision-making component. At present, the SAE – QEI can only be used to prepare for the multiple-choice component of the MCCQE Part I.

**Examination demo**


The MCC is pleased to offer demonstration versions of the multiple-choice question (MCQ) component and the clinical decision-making (CDM) component of the MCCQE Part I.

The MCCQE Part I Online Demo provides a demonstration of how the computer-based examination operates. Candidates will be able to familiarize themselves with the computer-testing environment and learn about each feature before using it in the actual examination. The MCCQE Part I Online Demo includes 28 questions in the MCQ section and six cases in the CDM. The correct answers are provided and answers that the user submits will not be scored. The last screen of the demo shows the Item Reviewing feature that replicates what will be seen on the actual examination.

[View the MCCQE Part I MCQ demo.](https://apps.mcc.ca/qe1_demo/StartPage.aspx?e=1)

[View the MCCQE Part I CDM demo.](https://apps.mcc.ca/qe1_demo/StartPage.aspx?e=2)

*Please note that the time remaining functionality within the demo is no longer available in the actual MCCQE Part I. The site staff will inform candidates of the time remaining throughout the examination.

**Instructional video**

The MCC has created instructional videos for both the MCQ component and the CDM component. They are offered in French and English. Candidates are strongly encouraged to view these videos prior to the examination to become familiar with the examination interface and functionality. Each instructional video clip lasts approximately 20 minutes. There will be no time available to view these videos on examination day.

**Objectives for the Qualifying Examination**

Using the Objectives for the Qualifying Examination as a study guide may be helpful for candidates taking the MCCQE Part I. Note that the Objectives are organized in terms of clinical presentations. Under each clinical presentation is a set of learning objectives that are exactly what candidates have to know for any of the MCC examinations.

When studying for an examination, candidates should systematically go through each clinical presentation and carefully read the related objectives. If candidates feel that their knowledge or skills related to a given objective is weak, then they know that this objective needs further study and will require them to consult a medical reference/textbook. The MCC test committee members use the clinical presentations and learning objectives listed in this resource when creating test questions.


**Transition to DSM-5**

In May 2013 the American Psychiatric Association published the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).

Over 2014 and 2015, the MCCEE computer-based questions will be updated to include the new DSM-5 language. These updated questions will still include the DSM-IV-TR language, which will be featured in brackets after the DSM-5 terminology.

The first MCCQE Part I administration to include updated questions will be the spring 2014 session. For answers to MCCQE Part I clinical decision-making write-in questions, candidates will continue to receive full marks for correct answers regardless of whether they use DSM-5 or DSM-IV-TR language.

For more information, please visit Medical Council of Canada transition to DSM-5.

**Reference books**

The MCC has compiled a list of reference books that may be helpful in preparing for the examination.

**Candidate instructions**

Candidates are encouraged to review the instructions for the examination:

[Multiple-choice questions (MCQ) component](http://mcc.ca/wp-content/uploads/Exams-MCQ-candidate-instructions.pdf)

[Clinical decision making (CDM) component](http://mcc.ca/examinations/mccqe-part-i/clinical-decision-making/candidate-instructions/)

**Frequently asked questions**

Candidates are encouraged to review the MCCQE Part I frequently asked questions page.


http://mcc.ca/examinations/mccqe-part-i/scoring/

### Scoring ###

**Overview**

The Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination (MCCQE) Part I is scored independently of the MCCQE Part II. To be awarded the Licentiate of the Medical Council of Canada (LMCC), a candidate must pass both the MCCQE Part I and Part II.

The MCCQE Part I, like all Medical Council of Canada (MCC) exams is a criterion-referenced exam. This means that candidates who meet or exceed the standard will pass the exam regardless of how well other candidates perform on it.

**How are total scores and sub-scores calculated on the MCCQE Part I?**

The total score is calculated by combining multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and clinical decision-making questions (CDMs). MCQs are scored 1 point for a correct answer and scored 0 for an incorrect answer. For CDMs, there is a maximum of 1 point per question. Some questions, such as a question whose answer includes four correct elements, allow candidates to receive partial marks (e.g., 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 or 1). The MCCQE Part I total score is reported on a scale that ranges from 50 to 950. Discipline sub-scores include scores from MCQs only and the CDM sub-score includes scores from CDMs.

**How is the pass score established?**

The Medical Council of Canada (MCC) conducts a standard setting exercise every three to five years to ensure that the standard and the pass score remain appropriate. Standard setting is a process used to define an acceptable level of performance and to establish a pass score.

To this end, the MCC completed a rigorous standard setting exercise based on expert judgments from a panel of 17 physicians across the country that represented faculties of medicine, different specialties, and years of experience supervising students and residents. The Bookmark Method was used and has been successfully employed (and defended) with a number of large-scale exam programs around the world. Following the standard setting exercise, the new pass score was brought forward to the Central Examination Committee (CEC), which reviewed and approved the recommendation. The CEC is represented by physicians and medical educators from across the country. The members of this Committee are appointed by our Council annually. The CEC is responsible for the quality of our examinations and awards final results to our candidates (e.g., pass, fail).

Using the spring 2015 results of all MCCQE Part I candidates, the new scale was established to have a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100. Candidates results from the spring 2015 and subsequent exam sessions will be reported on this new scale allowing us to compare candidate performance across sessions beginning with the spring 2015 session. For example, a mean score of 510 on a future session would indicate a stronger performance of that group than the spring 2015 group that had a mean of 500. On this new scale, the pass score that was recommended from the standing setting panel and approved by the CEC is 427. This pass score will remain in place for subsequent MCCQE Part I sessions.

Prior to 2015, the pass score for the MCCQE Part I was 390 on the old 50 to 950 scale. The new pass score (427) translates to 440 on this old scale.

**How is a pass/fail decision made?**

A candidate’s final result (e.g., pass, fail) is determined by his or her total score and where it falls in relation to the examination pass score. A total score equal to or greater than the pass score is a pass and a total score less than the pass score is a fail. The candidate’s performance is judged in relation to the examination pass score and not judged on how well other individuals perform.

**What will appear on the Statement of Results and Supplemental Feedback Report?**

The SOR includes the candidate’s final result and total score, as well as the pass score. Additional information about discipline and CDM sub-scores and comparative information is provided on the SFR. See the help file for additional information on how to interpret the SFR. Both the SOR and the SFR are made available through the candidate’s physiciansapply.ca account.

 
http://mcc.ca/examinations/mccqe-part-i/result/

### Results ###

**Release of results**

Examination results are confirmed by the MCC Central Examination Committee, which meets in June for the spring administration and in December for the fall administration. After result confirmation, candidates will receive an email notification stating that they can verify their pass/fail result through their physiciansapply.ca account. The Statement of Results and the supplemental feedback report will be posted in candidates’ physiciansapply.ca accounts shortly thereafter.

To prevent errors or fraud and for reasons of confidentiality, results cannot be given over the phone, by fax or by email.

Candidates applying to an organization that requires submission of certified copies of the Statement of Results or the supplemental feedback report can request that the MCC send certified copies. There is an administrative fee for this service.

**How results are communicated**

The Medical Council of Canada (MCC) issues candidates a Statement of Results through their physiciansapply.ca account. The Statement of Results includes the candidate’s final result and total score as well as the score that was required to pass the examination. The MCC also provides supplemental feedback on candidates’ examination performance through their physiciansapply.ca account. The MCC provides an example of a previously issued Statement of Results and the supplemental feedback report for the Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination Part I (MCCQE Part I).

**Fails**

The MCC does not limit the number of times a candidate may attempt the MCCQE Part I. However, candidates who have been awarded a pass result on the MCCQE Part I cannot retake the examination in an attempt to obtain a higher score.

**Rescore requests**


Only candidates who have failed the MCCQE Part I can request a rescoring of their examination; candidates with a pass result are not eligible for the rescoring service. Rescore requests must be submitted by Sept. 1 for the spring exam, or by March 1 for the fall exam. Requests will be accepted upon receipt of a written request and a credit card payment of the applicable fee.

Candidates can choose between two rescoring options:

1. [Rescoring by the MCC](http://mcc.ca/examinations/rescoring-by-mcc/)
1. [Rescoring with the candidate present at the MCC’s office](http://mcc.ca/examinations/rescoring-with-candidate-present/)

After the examination, all final results are verified at least three times before being sent to the candidates. Borderline results (i.e., those within a close range of the passing score) undergo increased review. Given the additional scrutiny that the MCC gives to borderline results, it is unlikely that rescoring the examination will produce a change in result. Three potential outcomes can occur as a result of the rescoring of the examination: no change in score, change in score but no change in the fail result, or change in score and change in fail to pass result. If the rescoring produces a change in score or a change in score and final result, the MCC will issue a new Statement of Results and supplemental feedback report to the candidate through his or her physiciansapply.ca account.

**Appeals**

Any MCCQE Part I candidate who has been denied standing, including any denial of entry to future examinations, or who considers that the results of an examination have been prejudiced by the conduct of the examination may appeal to the Appeals Committee. Candidates cannot seek to appeal the content of the examination.

Any candidate wishing to launch an appeal must notify the Executive Director in writing within 45 days of the decision of the Central Examination Committee. For more information on the appeal process for the MCCQE Part I, please review the MCC bylaws.

http://mcc.ca/examinations/mccqe-part-ii/

## Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination Part II ##

The Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination Part II assesses the competence of candidates, specifically the knowledge, skills, and attitudes essential for medical licensure in Canada prior to entry into independent clinical practice.

This examination consists of a series of clinical stations including pilot stations that do not count towards a candidate’s total score. At each station, a brief written statement introduces a clinical problem and directs the candidate to appropriately examine a standardized (simulated) patient as well as perform activities such as obtaining a focused history, conducting a focused physical examination, or assessing and addressing the patient’s issues. Candidates may be asked to answer specific questions related to the patient, interpret X-rays or the results of other investigations, make a diagnosis and/or write admission orders.

This examination includes problems in Medicine, Pediatrics, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Preventive Medicine and Community Health, Psychiatry and Surgery, as well as in similar disciplines considered essential for competence in general medicine and health care.

As a result of the new exam structure for family medicine starting in 2016, MCC is seeing increased candidate demand for the MCCQE Part II across sessions. Capacity limits were in place for the fall 2015 MCCQE Part II. Candidates who attempted to apply for the fall 2015 MCCQE Part II after capacity limits had been reached were able to select to be added to a preregistration list for the spring 2016 MCCQE Part II.

Candidates on the pre-registration list will be able to apply during the pre-registration period in November 2015. General registration, which will open after the pre-registration period has closed, will be available to all physicians who have completed their training or who are in their PGY-2 year or above. MCC expects to have enough capacity during the pre-registration and general registration periods for all eligible PGY-2+ candidates (including physicians who have completed their training).

New this year – the MCC has changed the eligibility criteria for the MCCQE Part II . PGY-1 candidates completing their first year of residency by June 30, 2016, will be able to apply to the spring 2016 MCCQE Part II. The registration period for PGY-1 candidates will open in January 2016, and capacity will be very limited.

**Application for the spring 2016 MCCQE Part II**

MCC will provide three application periods for the spring 2016 MCCQE Part II:

- The pre-registration period – opening the week of Nov. 16, 2015
  - This registration period is available only for those candidates who are on the pre-registration list
  - These candidates attempted to apply for fall 2015 after the exam capacity was reached and could not complete the application process at that time, and selected to place their name on the pre-registration list
- General application will open during the week of Nov. 23, 2015
- PGY-1 registration – expected to open the week of Jan. 4, 2016


- For information regarding centre assignment, please visit the Centre selection page

### Exam capacity ###


**How will the capacity limits be applied?**

Note: Application to the MCCQE Part II is now closed. We anticipate that application to the spring 2016 MCCQE Part II exam will open in November 2015.


The MCC must ensure that a large enough sample of first-time Canadian graduate candidates take the exam in each session to maintain the reliability, validity and comparability of scores.

Having a large enough sample of first-time Canadian graduate candidates in each session ensures that candidates taking the exam in a given session are not penalized or advantaged if they receive more difficult or easier OSCE stations. The level of difficulty can be determined and exam scores adjusted.

Capacity limits are also in place for other candidates. This will ensure that the exam is taken by a diverse group of candidates across both sessions, thus enabling physician examiners to better assess against a common standard.

MCC reserved a proportional number of spots in the fall 2015 MCCQE Part II session for eligible candidates who will pass the spring 2015 MCCQE Part I or fail the spring 2015 MCCQE Part II.

The caps for these three groups (first-time Canadian graduates; IMGs, US graduates and Canadian graduate repeat test takers; and candidates receiving results from the spring exams) have been further subdivided by English and French exam spots, as exam centres are language-specific. The caps have been proportionally set based on historical candidate volumes. Historical withdrawal rates were also taken into account and added to the number of spots available.

**What happens after a capacity limit is reached?**

Candidates who apply will be able to register until the cap for their group has been reached. Depending on the rate of application, candidates in certain groups will be able to continue to apply for the exam after capacity has been reached for other groups.

Once the limit has been reached for a specific group, candidates from that group going through the application process will be notified that spots are no longer available, and will be asked whether they want to be added to a pre-registration list for the following session.

Candidates on the pre-registration list will be provided the option of registering for the spring 2016 MCCQE Part II before general registration opens in fall 2015. The option of being added to the spring 2016 pre-registration list will only be available during the fall 2015 exam’s registration period to candidates who started the application process and could not submit an application because the limit had been reached for their group.

**Why are capacity limits being introduced for the fall 2015 MCCQE Part II?**

Over the past five years, there has been a significant increase in the number of candidates taking the MCCQE Part II. Exam sites have been able to accommodate the increased candidate numbers because they were more or less evenly distributed over the spring and fall session every year. Now, with the announcement of a new exam structure for family medicine starting in 2016, MCC is expecting that candidate demand for the fall 2015 MCCQE Part II will be very high.

After exploring several options to address this issue, the MCC will implement specific capacity limits – or caps – across candidate groups. This approach will allow the MCC to maintain the rigour and psychometric validity of exam scores while also ensuring that the exam will be offered in as many centres as possible across both the spring and fall sessions.

**Can the exam capacity be increased?**

The MCC has already added capacity to the fall 2015 exam (more than seven per cent increase over fall 2014 candidate volumes). We will also add more candidate spots in the fall of 2016. Additional capacity will be available given that the harmonized examination will not be offered. The “spots” from the harmonized exam will be transferred to the MCCQE Part II.

**Can candidates be added to a wait list?**

To be equitable, the MCC decided to add historical withdrawal rates to the number of spots available across all candidate groups instead of implementing a waiting list.

Implementing a waiting list might negatively impact fairness for candidates. For example, if we had someone withdraw after the registration closed, we would have candidates from the different groups on the waiting list. We would not necessarily be able to offer the spot to the person “next on the list”, given that we also have to ensure that a minimum number of first-time Canadian graduates take the exam across both sessions.

**Are the limits impacted by the candidate’s centre choices?**

The capacity limits are independent of the candidate’s centre choices. Once capacity has been reached for a given group (e.g., for English first-time Canadian graduates), any additional candidate from that group will be notified that this limit has been reached. Separate limits have been established for the three groups and then further sub-divided by language, but they are not impacted by the candidate’s centre choices.

**Candidate orientation presentation**

The interactive orientation presentation is now available.

**Objectives for the Qualifying Examination**


The Medical Council of Canada uses the Objectives for the Qualifying Examination as the basis for the MCCQE Part I and II. The Objectives have been defined in behavioural terms, and reflect our expectations of competent physicians.

The assumption has been made that it is better to prevent than treat, and that rational treatment is possible only after a diagnosis has been established. The Objectives deal with data gathering, diagnostic clinical problem solving, and the principles of management, which are applicable, in part of or whole, to clinical situations faced by physicians.

The MCCQE Part II is based on common or critical patient presentations related to the Objectives. Consider organizing your study similarly, rather than studying by disease or body system. Working from common or critical presenting problems from different disciplines, by yourself or with others, will align your studying with the format of the examination. For each patient presentation, identify key diagnoses, the critical information needed for diagnosis (and to rule out the differential diagnoses) and to treat, list key aspects of the physical examination, and consider what investigations might be needed, as well as summarizing key aspects of initial management of each problem.

**Transition to DSM-5**

In May 2013 the American Psychiatric Association published the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).

Over 2014 and 2015, the MCCEE computer-based questions will be updated to include the new DSM-5 language. These updated questions will still include the DSM-IV-TR language, which will be featured in brackets after the DSM-5 terminology.

Candidates answering questions asked by the physician examiner, or providing written answers on the post-encounter probe, can use either DSM-5 or DSM-IV-TR language where appropriate.

For more information, please visit Medical Council of Canada transition to DSM-5.

http://mcc.ca/examinations/mccqe-part-ii/scoring/

### Scoring ###

**Overview**

The Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination (MCCQE) Part II is scored independently of the MCCQE Part I. To be awarded the Licentiate of the Medical Council of Canada (LMCC), a candidate must pass both the MCCQE Part I and Part II.

The MCCQE Part II, like all Medical Council of Canada (MCC) exams is a criterion-referenced exam. This means that candidates who meet or exceed the standard will pass the exam regardless of how well other candidates perform on it.

The MCCQE Part II component is evaluated by physician examiners based on the candidate’s performance at each station.

**How are OSCE stations scored**

Objectivity is achieved through the use of standardized guidelines, the training of physician examiners and of standardized patients, and the use of predetermined station-specific scoring instruments for objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) stations.

OSCE stations are scored by the physician examiner using a checklist of tasks (see sample OSCE cases below for details). In almost all stations, the physician examiner also scores selected rating scale items related to the candidate’s interactions with the patient. For example, the physician examiner may be rating the candidate on “Questioning Skills” and/or “Organization of Physical Examination” and/or “Rapport with Person”.

In the case of couplet stations where the candidate is required to answer written questions, the candidate is also scored on his or her answers in the post-encounter probe. Physician examiners score candidates’ answers following the exam. For examples of the post-encounter probe questions and the correct answers, view the post-encounter probe for the history-taking station or the physical examination station below.

Candidates are expected to demonstrate appropriate, ethical and professional behaviour. When filling out the physician examiner checklist, physician examiners are asked whether the candidate’s performance was unsatisfactory and to specify the reason(s) for the unsatisfactory performance. Physician examiners must also answer the question: Did this candidate demonstrate a lapse in professional behaviour? If answering “yes”, the physician examiners must then elaborate on the observed lapse.

**How are total scores and subscores calculated on the MCCQE Part II?**

Each station is worth the same as every other station and a candidate’s total score is the average of his or her station scores. The total score is adjusted to reflect the level of difficulty of the stations experienced by candidates on a given exam date. The MCC reports scores on a standard-score format ranging from 50 to 950.

Sub-scores are calculated by converting each item to a percentage (i.e., checklist, rating scale, written or oral questions) across the 12 stations and taking the average of the percentages associated with each domain. There are four domain sub-scores reported on the MCCQE Part II: Data Acquisition, Problem Solving and Decision Making, Patient/Physician Interaction, and C²LEO (the Considerations of the Cultural-Communication, Legal, Ethical, and Organizational aspects of the practice of medicine).

**How is the pass score established?**


The MCC conducts a standard setting exercise every three to five years to ensure that the standard and the pass score remain appropriate. Standard setting is a process used to define an acceptable level of performance and to establish a pass score.

To this end, the MCC completed a rigorous standard setting exercise based on expert judgments from a panel of 20 physicians across the country that represented faculties of medicine, different specialties, and years of experience supervising students and residents. The Borderline Group Method used by MCC has been successfully employed (and defended) with a number of large-scale exam programs around the world. Following the standard setting exercise, the new pass score was brought forward to the Central Examination Committee (CEC) which reviewed and approved the recommendation. The CEC is represented by physicians and medical educators from across the country. The members of this Committee are chairs of our examination test committees and are appointed by Council. The CEC is responsible for the quality of our examinations and awards final results to our candidates (e.g., pass, fail).

Using the spring 2015 results of all MCCQE Part II candidates, the new scale was established to have a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100. Candidate results from the spring 2015 and subsequent exam sessions will be reported on this new scale allowing us to compare candidate performance across sessions beginning with the spring 2015 session. For example, a mean score of 510 on a future administration would indicate a stronger performance of that group than the spring 2015 group that had a mean of 500. On this new scale, the pass score that was recommended from the standard setting panel and approved by the CEC is 509. This pass score will remain in place for subsequent MCCQE Part II sessions.

Prior to 2015, the pass score for the MCCQE Part II was 475 on the old 50 to 950 scale. The new pass score (509) translates to 494 on the old scale.

**How is a pass/fail decision made?**

A candidate’s final result (e.g., pass, fail) is determined by his or her total score and where it falls in relation to the examination pass score. A total score equal to or greater than the pass score is a pass and a total score less than the pass score is a fail. The candidate’s performance is judged in relation to the examination pass score and not judged on how well other individuals performed.

**What will appear on the Statement of Results (SOR) and on the Supplemental Feedback Report (SFR)?**

The SOR includes the candidate’s final result and total score, as well as the pass score. Additional information about the total and sub-scores is provided on the SFR. The total score is reported on a standard-score scale ranging from 50 to 950. In contrast, the score profile in Figure 1 of the SFR displays a candidate’s domain sub-scores that indicate a candidate’s relative strengths and weaknesses in four areas. As a result, total scores cannot be compared to the score profile in the SFR as both are reported on different scales. Both the SOR and the SFR are made available through the candidate’s physiciansapply.ca account.

**New in 2015 – changes to the SFR**

Candidates from previous sessions may recall that their report contained a table with stations listed from high performance to low performance. As of 2015, the MCC has removed this table from the SFR as the information it contained, while correct, could be misinterpreted and/or misleading.

The table provided a rank order of stations, but candidate performance in some cases was equal, close to equal, or not equidistant across all stations. As a result of this change, in 2015 the report will be one page instead of two.

http://mcc.ca/examinations/mccqe-part-ii/results/

### Results ###

**Release of results**

Examination results are confirmed by the MCC Central Examination Committee, which meets in June for the spring administration and in December for the fall administration.

After result confirmation, candidates will receive an email notification stating that they can verify their pass/fail result through their physiciansapply.ca account. The Statement of Results and the supplemental feedback report will be posted in candidates’ physiciansapply.ca accounts shortly thereafter. For candidates who have passed the examination, the MCC will also send out a package by mail with the candidate’s Licentiate documents.

Candidates applying to an organization that requires submission of certified copies of the Statement of Results or the supplemental feedback report can request that the MCC send certified copies. There is an administrative fee for this service

To prevent errors or fraud and for reasons of confidentiality, results cannot be given over the phone, by fax or by email.

**How results are communicated**

The Medical Council of Canada (MCC) issues candidates a Statement of Results through their physiciansapply.ca account. The Statement of Results includes the candidate’s final result and final score as well as the score that was required to pass the examination. The MCC also provides supplemental feedback on candidates’ examination performance through their physiciansapply.ca account. The MCC has prepared a help file to assist candidates in interpreting their MCCQE Part II supplemental feedback report.

**Licenciate packages**

Candidates should ensure that the mailing address the MCC has on file is up to date so that the Licentiate packages are sent to the correct address. The MCC must receive an address change at least two weeks before the mailing of Licentiate packages. If a candidate does not submit a change in address, he or she will be required to wait for the original package to be returned to the MCC so that it can be redirected to the new address. Candidates should update their mailing address through their physiciansapply.ca account.

**Fails**

The MCC does not limit the number of times a candidate may attempt the MCCQE Part II. However, candidates with a pass result on the MCCQE Part II cannot retake the examination in an attempt to obtain a higher score.

**Rescore requests**



Only candidates who have failed the MCCQE Part II can request a rescore; candidates with a pass result are not eligible for the rescoring service.

It is important for candidates to note that scores are verified several times before results are released. Given this scrutiny, it is unlikely that rescoring the examination will produce a change in result.

Candidates who wish to have their examination rescored must:

- Submit a message through their physiciansapply.ca account that includes an explanation for the rescore request and their mailing address
- Complete a Credit card authorization form including the applicable fee
- Check the box next to “Other Fee” and indicate “Rescore request – MCCQE Part II
- Send the completed form by email (service@mcc.ca) or fax (613-248-5234)

Fees are refunded if a rescore leads to a change in the final result (i.e., change from fail to pass).

Deadlines for filing MCCQE Part II rescore requests are September 1 for the spring exam and March 1 for the fall exam.

An MCCQE Part II rescore includes the following steps:

- Authentication of all parts of your examination, including a complete file review (incident reports and physician comments)
- Verification of the computer-scanned answer sheets for anomalies (torn sheets, stray marks, ink marks, etc.)
- Verification of raw computer data against physician-completed answer sheets
- Verification of the computer file scores against those reported in the result letter

A rescore does NOT include a re-evaluation of the candidate’s performance by additional examiners.

If the rescoring produces a change in final result, the MCC will issue a new Statement of Results and Supplemental Feedback Report to the candidate through his or her physiciansapply.ca account. The MCC will also send out a package by mail with the candidate’s Licentiate documents.

Rescores are processed within four to six weeks from the date they are received.

**Appeals**

Any MCCQE Part II candidate who has been denied standing, including any denial of entry to future examinations, or who considers that the results of an examination have been prejudiced by the conduct of the examination may appeal to the Appeals Committee. Candidates cannot seek to appeal the content on the examination.

Any candidate wishing to launch an appeal must notify the Executive Director in writing within 45 days of the decision of the Central Examination Committee. For more information on the appeal process for the MCCQE Part II, please review the MCC bylaws.
