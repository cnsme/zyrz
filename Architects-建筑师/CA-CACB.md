### 认证模式 Modes of Certification - 飞出国 ### 

在向加拿大各省建筑师协会申请注册之前，申请人必须先向CACB申请学历认证。学历认证之后，必须完成其所注册省的注册要求，包括实习和考试。

在加拿大，有4种方式可以满足加拿大省建筑师协会的教育标准。

> Prior to registration with any of the provincial associations of architects in Canada, applicants must have their academic qualifications certified by the CACB. Following certification of their academic qualifications, applicants are then required to complete the licensing requirements (including internship and exams) for the province in which they wish to register.
> 
> There are four ways to satisfy the Canadian Education Standard for admission to provincial architectural associations in Canada:

**1. 认可的专业项目Accredited professional program**

如果申请人毕业于建筑学专业，且得到加拿大建筑师认证协会、全国建筑师认证局或该局授权的其他认证机构的认可，就符合要求。

> Applicants may qualify through graduation from a professional program of architectural education which has been accredited by the Canadian Architectural Certification Board (CACB), or by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB), or an accrediting body recognized by the Board.

**2.未经CABA认可的专业项目 Professional program not accredited by CACB.**

该认证模式适用于以下毕业生：

- 在加拿大建筑师认证体系实施之前，毕业于加拿大建筑学校；
- 毕业于国外建筑学校

有以上学历/文凭的申请人得到CACB认证（有一个详细的个人评估记录）后，就满足加拿大教育标准了。

> This mode of certification applies to the following graduates:
> 
> - Graduates of Canadian Schools of Architecture prior to the implementation of the Accreditation System for architecture in Canada; and
> - Graduates of Foreign Schools of Architecture
> 
> Applicants with such degrees/diplomas can meet the Canadian Education Standard by obtaining CACB certification following a detailed evaluation of the individual's record.

**3.省协会注册的建筑师 Architects registered by a provincial association**

符合以下任一情况的建筑师，均被视为有同等学历，符合加拿大教育标准：

- 1976年1月1日以前，在省协会注册的建筑师
- 1992年以前在魁北克建筑师机构注册过的建筑师
- 1992年以前学历得到阿尔伯特大学协调委员会认证的建筑师

> Architects who were registered prior to July 1, 1976 by a provincial association, or by the Ordre des architectes du Québec prior to 1992, or whose education was certified by the Universities Coordinating Council in Alberta prior to 1992, are accepted as having equivalent education to satisfy the Canadian Education Standard.

**4.通过RAIC大纲学习项目满足加拿大教育标准 Satisfaction of the Canadian Education Standard through the RAIC Syllabus of Studies**

如果完成了加拿大皇家建筑师协会（RAIC）教学大纲学习项目中规定的课程和指导研究，并取得相应证书，且满足加拿大教育标准，就可以获得CACB学历认证。

> Applicants who have received a Diploma from the RAIC Syllabus of Studies Program upon completion of requisite courses and guided studies, may obtain the CACB certification if they comply with the Canadian Education Standard.

## 加拿大教育标准CES - Canadian Education Standard - 飞出国 ##

### A部分-加拿大教育标准原则 PART A Principles of A Canadian Education Standard ###

省和领地法律赋予每个司法管辖区的职业监管机构制定职业能力标准的权利和责任，申请人只有符合了规定的能力标准才能执业。每个司法管辖区的职业能力通过正规教育、规定的工作经验和考试等方式审核。特殊情况下，如果申请人可以通过其他方式证明其能力满足要求，则不必通过以上规定的方式。

CACB于1976年通过加拿大执照局（CALA）委员会协议而建立，负责对个人的建筑学专业学历或证书进行评估。该评估依据监管部门制定的标准和流程来执行。1992年和2002年，魁北克建筑师协会和加拿大西北领地建筑师协会分别加入加拿大建筑师认证委员会（CACB）。

Board of Directors负责管理CACB并为其制定政策。

CACB认证流程和学历认证标准是根据UNESCO/UIA Charter中关于建筑师学历规定的核心原则和UIA Accord的国际推荐标准（Recommended International Standards）中关于专业建筑师执业的相关材料而制定的。CACB作为监管机构的代表，是全国建筑师认证和委员会（美国）和建筑师注册委员会（美国）的组成部分，签订了关于建筑学学历堪培拉协议，该协议于2008年获批，2010年正式实施。

> Provincial and Territorial legislation has given each professional governing body both the authority and the responsibility to establish standards of competence for candidates seeking to practise architecture in their jurisdiction. Each jurisdiction has chosen to have this professional competence normally obtained and demonstrated through a combination of formal education, supervised experience and examination. Each jurisdiction may also, under extraordinary circumstances, exempt a candidate from some of these normal requirements if competency can be demonstrated by other reliable means.
> 
> The Canadian Architectural Certificate Board (CACB) was established in 1976 by an agreement of the Councils of the Canadian Architectural Licensing Authorities (Regulators), who grant it the authority to act on their behalf in assessing the educational qualification of individuals holding a professional degree or diploma in architecture. The assessments are made in accordance with standards and procedures established by the Regulators. L'Ordre des architectes du Québec joined the CACB in 1992, and the Northwest Territories Association of Architects in 2002. 
> 
> *The CACB is governed by a Board of Directors (the Board), which establishes the policies of the CACB. The Board appoints a Registrar who is empowered to issue a Certification of Educational Qualificate to persons so qualification and Assessment Committees who act on behalf of the Board and recommend to the Registrar.*
> 
> The CACB procedures for Certification and the education standards against which qualification are measured, have been developed in accordance with both the core principles of the UNESCO/UIA Charter for Architectural Education and the relevant sections of the UIA Accord on Recommended International Standards on Professionalism in Architectural Practice. The CACB, acting on behalf of the Regulators, is part of working agreements with the National Architectural Accrediting & Board (USA) and the National Council of Architectural Registration Boards (USA), and is a signatory to the Canberra Accord on Architectural Education, which was ratified in 2008 for implementation in 2010.

#### CACB 认证 CACB Certification - 飞出国 ###

通常，学历必须满足CACB规定的专业学历要求,才能进行后续的注册或登记流程。学历认证是根据该文件B和C部分的标准进行评估。满足监管机构的学历要求后，申请人需要完成所注册省份或领地的其他要求。不同省份或领地有不同的要求，时间不同，相应的法律发生变化，其要求也会有所变化。当前的注册信息可以从相应的监管机构进行了解。

> Normally, applicants must have their academic qualifi certifi as having met the educational requirement for entry to the profession by the CACB prior to, or as a part of, the application process for registration or licensure with any of the Canadian Architectural Licensing Authorities. The assessment of credentials for certifi is conducted in accordance with Parts B and C of this document. Following certification by the CACB that their academic qualifi meet the standard established by the Regulators, applicants are required to complete the remaining requirements for the province or territory in which they wish to be registered or licensed. These requirements vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may be affected from time to time by new legislation or changes in bylaws. Current information concerning requirements for registration or licensure should be obtained from the Regulator concerned.

### 加拿大标准和流程 Canadian Standards & Procedures - 飞出国 ###

当前适用的能力标准是指必须有正规教育学历，且得到Regulators的一致认可。对专业学历（CACB或NAAB认可和不认可的均包含在内）进行评估的流程和标准是在它的基础上发展而来的。针对不同背景和情况的均适用，且保证了评估的公正性。不同类型的申请人有不同的标准，这些标准不完全相同，却是等同的。

> Those current competency standards that are expected, by a consensus of the Regulators, to be achieved and demonstrated through formal education have been applied to the development of standards and procedures for the assessment of both professional degrees accredited by the CACB or NAAB, and professional degrees or diplomas not accredited by the CACB or NAAB. These standards and procedures have been chosen to assure that the assessments are equitable in each case, while accommodating the varied backgrounds and circumstances of the applicants. This results in standards for each category of applicant that are equivalent but not identical.

### B部分-认证条件和流程 PART B Conditions and Procedures for Certification - 飞出国 ###

#### 条件 Conditions ####

**1. 认可的专业学历 Accredited Professional Degree**

取得CACB、NAAB或其他Registors授权机构认可的建筑专业学历后，CACB会授予申请人证书，证明其学历满足成为专业建筑师的学历要求。CACB建筑专业学历认证条件和流程文件上注明了建筑项目详细的评估流程和标准，也注明了个体申请人认证学历的认证流程（附录 A）。认证期间，这些标准和流程将被应用在大学建筑专业项目上，而不是应用在个人学历认证上。认可的专业学历是学士、硕士或博士学历。建筑学学前教育专业学位（Pre-professional degrees ）和后期专业（post-professional degrees）学位不符合学历要求。

> Applicants may be granted CACB certificate that their education meets the standards for entry to the profession following graduation from a professional program of architectural education that has been accredited by the CACB, by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB), or by any other body recognized by the Regulators.While this document outlines the procedures for the Certification of an individual applicant's accredited degree, the detailed procedures and standards for the evaluation of architecture programs seeking or maintaining accreditation are described in the document CACB Conditions and Procedures for Accreditation of Professional Degree Programs in Architecture (Appendix A).These Conditions and Procedures are meant to be applied to university professional programs in architecture during a periodic accreditation process, and not to the credentials of individual graduates. An accredited professional degree may be granted at either the Bachelor's, the Master's or the Doctor's level. Pre-professional degrees in architectural studies by themselves, and post-professional degrees in related fi do not satisfy the requirements in this section.

**2.非CACB认可的专业学历/文凭 Degree or Diploma Not Accredited by the CACB**

如果申请人有建筑学学历，且符合自己国家的注册要求，但是没有在CACB或NAAB进行认证，可以申请CACB认证来确定一下自己的学历是否满足C-2部分的课程要求，自己的工作是否满足C-3部分的performance标准。这包含当前被认可的加拿大建筑学校毕业生（必须在该学校被CACB认可之前得到学历）。

该过程包括对个人学业成绩的详细评估。评估要求注明在C部分-非认可学历的评估流程和标准。

已获得来自RAIC教学大纲建筑学毕业文凭Graduate Diploma in Architecture 的申请人，经过必需课程和指导性研究方面的审核后（根据本文件C部分的performance标准进行审核）,就有可能得到CACB的学历认证。

> Applicants with a valid degree or diploma in architecture that is a fi professional degree or diploma and is accepted as a requirement for registration or licensure in its country of origin, but is not accredited by the CACB or the NAAB, may apply for CACB certifi to determine whether their education, or the degree program, meets the curriculum standards of Part C-2 and in the judgment of the CACB, the candidate's work meets the performance standards of Part C-3 of this document. This includes a graduate from a currently accredited Canadian school of architecture whose degree was granted prior to the school being accredited by the CACB.
> 
> The process involves a detailed evaluation of the individual's academic record. The requirements for this evaluation are described in Part C, Procedures and Standards for Assessment of Non-accredited Degrees or Diplomas.
> 
> Applicants who have received a Graduate Diploma in Architecture from the RAIC Syllabus of Studies, may be granted CACB Certificate following a review of the requisite courses and guided studies, against the performance standards described in Part C of this document.

**3.认证程序实施之前注册的建筑师 Architects Registered Prior to Adoption of the Certification Process**

监管部门（Regulators）认为以下情况的建筑师已经有同等学历，符合加拿大教育标准，提交申请后可以被授予加拿大建筑师协会的证书。

- 1976年1月1日以前，在省协会注册的建筑师
- 1992年以前在魁北克建筑师机构注册过的建筑师
- 1992年以前学历得到阿尔伯特大学协调委员会认证的建筑师

> The Regulators have agreed that Architects who were registered or licensed prior to July 1, 1976 by a provincial association, or by the Ordre des architectes du Québec prior to 1992, or whose education was certified by the Universities Coordinating Council in Alberta prior to 1992, are accepted as having equivalent education to satisfy the Canadian Education Standard, and may be granted CACB Certifi upon application.

**4. 消除教育学历缺陷 Removing Education Deficiencies**

如果对照课程和表现标准评估后，认为申请人的专业学历有缺陷，可以选择以下方式消除学历缺陷。如果是通识教育或选修科目有缺陷，可以在任意大学学习相关课程，包括RAIC大纲学习，也可以在已得到CACB认可的社区学院学习相关课程。

如果历史、人类行为、环境、技术体系或专业执业科目有缺陷，可以在任意建筑学校学习（该学校的专业学历需得到CACB的认可）或是通过RAIC大纲学习。如果申请人在无CACB认可项目的院校学习了相关课程，但该课程已得到CACB的认可，那么也会被认可。如果院校将学分分配到相关学科上且有同等的考试或者该学分标注在院校的官方成绩单上，那么该学分也可以用来弥补相应学科上的缺陷。

如果设计科目有缺陷，可以在校内或校外工作室、有CACB认可项目的学校或通过RAIC大纲学习来消除学历缺陷。这样的工作室必须由design faculty 管理和监督，必须有学分。

当学历缺陷消除后，官方成绩单和/或同等的考试分数报告会由院校直接送到CACB或相关考试机构。如果申请人以前被授予过有Conditional Certification,经the Registrar 认可后，CACB会证实已符合条件，然后授予申请人一个正式的证书。

> If an assessment identifies deficiencies in an applicant's professional degree/diploma program when compared with the Curriculum and Performance Standards below, one or more of the following options may be selected to remove the deficiencies
> If the defi is in the general education and elective subject area, relevant courses may be taken at any university, including the RAIC Syllabus of Studies, or at a community college that has been approved by the CACB prior to enrolment in the courses.
> 
> If the deficiencies is in history, human behavior, environment, technical systems or professional practice subject areas, relevant courses may be taken at any school of architecture whose professional degree program is accredited by the CACB or through the RAIC Syllabus of Studies. 
> 
> Courses taken at institutions without a CACB accredited program may be accepted if approved by the CACB prior to enrolment in the courses. If an academic institution grants credit in relevant subjects on the basis of equivalency examinations administered by the institution, and if that credit is listed on an offi transcript issued by that institution, then that credit may be used to remove deficiencies in these subject areas.
> 
> If the deficiencies is in the design subject area, on-campus or off-campus design studios may be taken at or through an institution with a CACB accredited program, or through the RAIC Syllabus of Studies Program. Such studios must be administered or monitored by the design faculty and must be taken for academic credit.
> 
> When deficiencies have been removed, office transcripts and/or equivalency examination score reports must be sent to the CACB directly by the academic institution(s) and/or examination authority involved. If the applicant has been previously issued a Conditional Certification the CACB will verify that the conditions have been met and, following approval by the Registrar, a regular Certifi will be issued.

**5. 审核和申诉 Review and Appeals**

如果申请人对评估有任何异议（包括学历评估结果或是评估委员会的评估标准），可以书面向CACB进行申诉。CACB可能会再进行一次学历评估，无任何费用。一收到书面评估申请（包括再次评估的原因和相关材料文件），申请人的所有文件会被送到评估委员会，进行再次评估。

如果申请人不能根据个人情况提交所需的材料导致无法进行评估，评估委员会也许会要求申请人提供其他学业成绩的证明材料，包括口试和/或正确的研究生时的相关工作（post graduate professional work）。

### C部分-非认可学历的评估流程和标准 PART C Procedures and Standards for Assessment of Nonaccredited Degrees or Diplomas - 飞出国 ###

#### 1.评估流程 Assessment Procedures ####

对非认可学历进行评估认证时，以C部分中的等同的课程和Performance Standards为标准，可以确保申请的一致性和评估的公正性。

CACB会评估申请人的学历是否是被认可的专业学历。初步评估的依据是课程大纲，即将申请人的学业记录与CACB认可的学历要求对比。根据学业年限、结构和基础课程内容是否与课程标准要求一致，决定申请人是否合格。根据等同的学期小时，将申请人的学业分成规定的6大学科。

评估过程中，为确保材料的完整性，CACB工作人员可能会要求申请人提交其他材料。如果材料符合课程标准规定的要求，申请会被送到评估委员会进行最后的评估。如果学历不符合该类别的条件，会书面通知申请人，并退还一部分申请费。

CACB评估委员会定期对申请进行评估。评估委员会的评判标准是看申请人提供的详细课程内容是否与与C部分中的Performance Standards一致。

评估结果：

- 申请人的学历满足加拿大注册要求，并由监管部门颁发认证证书；
- 申请人的学历被认定为在某些学科有缺陷，且被要求完成某些CACB认可的课程来弥补缺陷；然后再评估委员会的建议下，监管部门会给申请人颁发有条件证书（Conditional Certificate）；
- 申请人的学历不符合加拿大注册要求。
 
监管部门会书面通知评估结果，评估周期一般为3到6个月（从申请和所有材料都提交开始算起）。如果监管部门不授予证书,申请人可以继续进修学习，然后再次申请学历认证。

> In assessing non-accredited degrees or diplomas for Certification, the following Course Equivalents and Performance Standards contained in Part C are used. This ensures consistency of application and fairness of assessments across the diverse types of programs available.
> 
> The CACB will determine whether the degree is a recognized fi professional degree or diploma. The Curriculum Standards are then applied to the degree or diploma for a preliminary evaluation, which relates an individual record to a CACB-accredited degree equivalent. Eligibility is determined on the basis of the length, structure and general content of the courses being evaluated and their substantial conformance with the Curriculum Standards. In determining eligibility, the evaluators assign the applicant's academic work to the six required subject areas, in accordance with semester hour equivalents as detailed below.
> 
> During this stage of the assessment, CACB staff may request further information in order to complete the applicant's file. If the file is determined to be in substantial compliance with the quantitative requirements of the Curriculum Standards, the application is forwarded to the CACB Assessment Committee for final assessment. If the degree or diploma is considered not eligible under this category, the applicant is notified in writing, and a portion of the application fee may be refunded.
> 
> The CACB Assessment Committee meets regularly to assess applications. The Assessment Committee considers the detailed course content as documented in the applicant's file to confi that the Performance Standards outlined in Part C/ Section 3 have been met.
> 
> The outcome of the assessment may be:
> 
> - that the applicant's academic qualification fulfill the educational component of the registration/licensure requirements in Canada and a Certifi is issued by the Registrar; or
> - that the Assessment Committee determines the applicant's academic qualifi to be defi in particular subject areas and the applicant is required to remove those deficiencies by successfully completing the appropriate courses of study approved by the CACB. In this case, and on a recommendation from the Assessment Committee, the Registrar may issue a Conditional Certificate or
> - that the applicant's academic qualifi do not fulfi the educational component of the registration/licensure requirements in Canada.
> 
> Applicants are notifi of the result of an assessment or of a Registrar's decision in writing, and the assessment process normally takes from 3 to 6 months from the time that the application, including all required documentation, is complete. If the Registrar does not grant Certification, an applicant may undertake additional studies, and then reapply for Certification

#### 2. 课程标准 Curriculum Standards - 飞出国 ####

CACB认可的专业学历如下：

- 建筑学学士学历-最少为5年制（或者为4年制,在魁北克有CEGEP）
- 建筑学硕士学历-最少3年学制且本科是不相关专业；或者2年硕士且有4年相关建筑专业学历；CACB也能会调整学历要求。

CACB等同学历要求160学期小时的学分，分为6大学科领域：

- 基础教育和选修课；
- 历史和人类行为；
- 环境；
- 设计和图形传播；
- 技术体系；
- 专业知识，包括建筑工作的法律和行政环境。

根据等同的学期小时数，评估者将申请人的学业分为各个学科领域进行评估。1个学期小时等于CACB认可课程的1小时或学期中CACB认可的每周实验指导的2小时。对于周期为1个季度的项目，1.5个季度所经历的小时数等于1学期小时。课程可能包含多个学科的指导，所以课程会视情况进行分配。

如果学历/文凭被认定为满足CACB同等学历要求（学制和基本内容），会根据各个学科所规定的Performance Standards对学科成绩进行评估。这2部分评估是评估委员会向监管部门提供建议的基础。Performance Standards与CACB认证条件和认证流程Student Performance Criteria一致，但不完全相同。Student Performance Criteria用于评估大学建筑学专业学历。

> The CACB evaluation accommodates recognized types of professional degree programs, the most common being:
> 
> - Bachelor of Architecture Program-requiring a minimum of five years of study (or 4 years following CEGEP in Quebec), or
> - Master of Architecture Program-requiring a minimum of three years of study following an unrelated bachelor's degree, or two years following a four-year, related pre-professional degree; and does not preclude variations approved by the CACB.
> 
> The CACB degree equivalent requires 160 semester hours of academic credit, grouped into six subject areas:
> 
> - general education and electives;
> - history and human behavior;
> - environment;
> - design and graphic communication;
> - technical systems;
> - knowledge of the profession, which also includes the legal and administrative context of architectural practice.
> 
> In determining course equivalency, the evaluators assign the applicant's academic work to the subject areas in accordance with semester hour equivalents. A semester hour is equivalent to 1 hour of CACB approved lecture or 2 hours of CACB approved laboratory/ studio instruction per week for the duration of the semester or term. For programs that operate on a quarter system, 1.5 quarter hours are equivalent to 1 semester hour. A course may consist of instruction in more than one subject area, so may be apportioned between subject areas as appropriate.
> 
> If the degree or diploma is determined to meet the CACB equivalent degree in length and general content, the academic record is evaluated against the Performance Standards required for the subject areas detailed below. This two-part assessment is the basis for the Assessment Committee's recommendation to the Registrar. The Performance Standards are consistent with, but not identical to, the Student Performance Criteria found in the CACB's Conditions and Procedures for Accreditation, which are used in the evaluation of university professional programs in architecture.
