**STEP 2**

Complete any eligibility requirements you do not currently satisfy. We recommend you do not start the application process:

- If you do not have evidence of English language proficiency. Achieve the required IELTS or TOEFL scores first.
- If you are an International Medical Graduate or Osteopath and have not passed the Medical Council of Canada Evaluating Examination (MCCEE). Pass this exam first unless you are being recruited to an academic appointment at an Alberta University Faculty of Medicine. Apply for the MCCEE through your physiciansapply account (see Step 3).
- If your postgraduate training does not meet our requirements. Successfully complete the required training first (must be in a formal, accredited training program).
- If you have been out of practice or formal postgraduate training for more than three years. Wait until you have returned to practice or formal postgraduate training for at least 12 months.


**STEP 3**

Set up an account with physiciansapply to:

- Apply for Medical Council of Canada (MCC) examinations
- View your MCC and National Assessment Collaboration (NAC) examination results
- Submit your medical credentials and documents for source verification (required for training completed outside Canada)
- Have your medical credentials translated if issued in a language other than English or French
- Share your medical credentials and exam results with medical regulatory authorities and organizations, with your consent
- Submit a Review of Qualifications for Alberta

**STEP 4**

After we receive your Review of Qualifications from physiciansapply, we will assess if you are eligible to move forward in the application process. We charge a $200 Cdn non-refundable fee for this assessment, payable when you submit the Review of Qualifications. Therefore, please ensure you meet ALL the requirements in Step 2 before you submit. (Note: This fee is in addition to any fees charged for your physiciansapply account.)

We will notify you of the results of your Review of Qualifications by email:

- If you are not eligible, we will explain why.
- If you are eligible, we will advise for which register (Provisional Register Conditional Practice OR General Register). We will also provide detailed instructions on how to proceed, including when you will have access to the complete application.

**STEP 5**

If we determine you are eligible for the General Register:

- Carefully follow the instructions outlined in the Review of Qualifications results email.
- This email will include information about the supporting documentation, assessments, fees and important timelines, etc. required to complete your application.
- Please ensure all required documentation is submitted and made available to the College through physiciansapply.

If we determine you are eligible for the Provisional Register Conditional Practice:

- Follow the advice we sent you in the Review of Qualifications results letter.
- Go to doctorjobsalberta.com or apljobs.ca to apply for a physician posting that is eligible for Alberta Health Services (AHS) sponsorship. You must have a Review of Qualifications results letter from the CPSA.
- If we do not receive a sponsorship form from AHS on your behalf within six months, your file will be closed and you will not be granted access to the application for registration process with the CPSA.


**STEP 6**

After your application file is complete, with all medical credentials and supporting documents submitted and verified (as applicable), the College will analyze your application and notify you whether or not you qualify for registration in Alberta. If you do, you will be provided with further instructions and details regarding completion of:

- an assessment, if required,
- final registration documents,
- registration appointment (in person or online, at the discretion of the Registrar), and
- payment of applicable fees and taxes.

**STEP 7**

If you qualify for registration, the College will issue you a practice permit and you will be entitled to practise medicine in Alberta.
