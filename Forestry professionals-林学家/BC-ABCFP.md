## ABCFP-不列颠哥伦比亚省林业专业人员协会##

不列颠哥伦比亚省林业专业人员协会负责不列颠哥伦比亚省专业林业人员和林业技术人员的注册和管理。在不列颠哥伦比亚省,早在1947年林业人员第一次同意帮助维护公众在省林业方面的利益作为对林业发展专有权的回报的时候,专业林业的发展就已经被监管。今天,我们是加拿大最大的专业林业协会并且第一个把林业技术人员包含在内。

> ## ABCFP - Association of BC Forest Professionals ##
> 
> The Association of BC Forest Professionals is responsible for registering and regulating British Columbia's professional foresters and forest technologists. Here in BC, the practice of professional forestry has been regulated since 1947 when foresters first agreed to help protect the public's interest in the province's forests in return for the exclusive right to practise forestry. Today, we are the largest professional forestry association in Canada and the first to include forest technologists.

## 注册专业林业人员(简称RPFs)##

- 负责不列颠哥伦比亚的森林的养护;

- 做出例如何时、何地和如何砍伐树木和重新造林的决定;

- 确保森林价值的保护,包括鱼类、野生动物以及水域等;

- 要求林业学士学位或者自然资源管理方面的林业学士学位。

RPF的功能和职责通常比注册林业技术人员定义更广泛,也许会提出包括为实现长远发展的复杂的森林管理制度的设计在内的森林和景观尺度问题。

> ## Registered Professional Foresters (RPFs) ##
> 
> - are responsible for looking after the forests of British Columbia.
> - make decisions such as when, where and how to harvest and reforest areas.
> - ensure the protection of forest values including fish, wildlife and water.
> - require a bachelor of science in forestry or natural resource management specializing in forestry.
> 
> The functions and accountabilities of an RPF are generally more broadly defined than those of a Registered Forest Technologist and may address forest and landscape scale issues including the design of complex forest management regimes to achieve long-term outcomes.

### 核心竞争力(只适用于ASFITs)###

[核心竞争力要求](http://member.abcfp.ca/WEB/abcfp/Files/core_competency_RPF_route.pdf)是专业林业人员在加拿大执业的最低要求。核心竞争力要求用来授权大学项目和评估注册专业林业人员的应试者。

这些标准阐述了应试者对于以下内容的熟知程度:

- 树林和林分动态;

- 森林景观、结构和功能;

- 森林管理;

- 林业经济与管理;

- 沟通、批判性推理;

- 信息获取和分析;

- 职业规范与道德规范。

**如何知道自己是否有成为RPF的核心竞争力**

**从林业认证项目毕业**

如果你从[认证林业项目](http://www.cfab.ca/English/programs.html)毕业,已经符合了核心竞争力标准,登记期间通常不需要再完成额外的竞争力要求。你可以作为FIT在ABCFP注册。

注释:拥有十年以上学位的申请者需要进一步评估以确定他们是否具有要求的核心竞争力。

**没有从林业认证项目毕业**

如果你没有从林业认证项目毕业,你需要完成证书评估以确定你是否满足核心竞争力要求,或者你需要弥补登记期间的欠缺。核心竞争力不足可以通过完成认证课程、在职培训、或者可能的话通过协会设置的资格考试体现。你可以作为ASFIT在ABCFP登记。

**如何进行学历评估**

ASFITs必须通过全国性的学历评估过程对他们的职业能力素质进行评估。详细信息例如申请人手册、指导和要求的表格请访问加拿大主页林业人员协会网站的学历评估过程页面。

*注释:这是一个基于证据的程序;你的责任是提供必要的文件证明你满足核心竞争力的要求。

**学历评估程序申请截止日期**

- 1月1日-冬季评估
- 4月1日-春季评估
- 6月1日-夏季评估
- 10月1日-秋季评估

**学历评估结果**

学历评估结果会在完成以后通知你,通常是在你申请日期以后的四个月内。

- 如果所有的能力标准都满足了,你可以继续完成ABCFP的实习和考试要求。

- 如果没有满足所有的能力标准,你需要以预先核准的专业发展计划为基础,在满足ABCFP的实习要求的时候完成所有的杰出能力要求。

**不同的申请标准 如果你在2009年6月之前通过**

2009年6月之前在旧的标准下通过的ASFIT和林业学生,仅在2015年11月30日之前可以按原来的标准完成他们的杰出能力要求。2015年11月30日之后就要采用新标准。

> ### Core Competency (ASFITs only) ###
> 
> [Core competency requirements](http://member.abcfp.ca/WEB/abcfp/Files/core_competency_RPF_route.pdf) are the minimum common requirements for admission to the practice of professional forestry across Canada. The core competency standard is used to accredit university programs and to evaluate the competency of Registered Professional Forester (RPF) candidates.
> 
> The standards describe how much a candidate must know about:
> 
> - Tree and stand dynamics;
> - Forest to landscape, structure and function;
> - Forest management;
> - Economics and administration of forestry;
> - Communication, critical reasoning;
> - Information acquisition and analysis; and
> - Professionalism and ethics.
> 
> **How Do I Know if I Have the Core Competencies to Become an RPF?**
> 
> **I graduated from an accredited forestry program.**
> 
> If you graduated from an [accredited forestry program](http://www.cfab.ca/English/programs.html), you have already met the core competency standards and will generally not be required to complete additional competency requirements during your enrolment period. You can enrol with the ABCFP as a Forester in Training (FIT). 
> 
> Note: applicants with degrees that are more than 10 years old will be assessed further to ensure that they have the required competencies.
> 
> **I have not graduated from an accredited forestry program.**
> If you have not graduated from an accredited program, you will need to complete a credential assessment which will determine whether you have met the core competency requirements or if you will need to fill in any gaps during your enrolment period. Core competency deficiencies may be addressed by completing accredited courses, on-the-job training, or, where available, through a qualifying exam set by the association. You can enrol with the ABCFP as an Allied Science Forester in Training (ASFIT).
> 
> **How Do I Get My Credentials Assessed?**
> 
> ASFITs must have their competencies evaluated through a national credential assessment process*. For detailed information, the applicant’s manual, instructions and required forms, visit the credential assessment process page on the Canadian Federation of Professional Foresters Associations website.
> 
> *Note:  This is an evidence-based process; the onus is on you to provide the necessary proof to demonstrate that you have met the core competency requirements. 
> 
> **Application Deadlines for the Credential Assessment Process**
> 
> - January 1 - winter assessment
> - April 1 - spring assessment
> - July 1 - summer assessment
> - October 1 - fall assessment
> 
> **Credential Assessment Results**
> 
> Results will be communicated to you after the assessments are completed which is usually within four months of the date you applied.
> 
> - If all of the competency standards are met, you can continue completing the ABCFP’s articling and exam requirements.
> - If all of the competency standards are not met, you will be required to complete all of the outstanding competency requirements, based on a pre-approved professional development plan, while completing the ABCFP articling requirements.
> 
> **Different Standards Apply If You Were Admitted Prior to June 2009**
> 
> ASFITS and Forestry Pupils who were admitted prior to June 2009, under the old standards, have only until November 30, 2015 to complete their outstanding requirements under the original standards. After November 30, 2015, you will have to switch to the new standards.
