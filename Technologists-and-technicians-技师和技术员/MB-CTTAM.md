## The Profiles for Technicians & Technologists ##

Although Canadians use the terms 'Technician' and 'Technologist' generally to describe many different occupations, Engineering/Applied Science Technicians and Technologists are very distinct individuals. These are the people who, through a high degree of specialized training may use, test, repair, design, analyze and problem solve in a broad range of applied science and engineering areas. They are employed in a vast range of economic sectors, from manufacturing to telecommunications. What are the differences between Technicians and Technologists? To answer that question, review the following detailed Canadian Council of Technicians & Technologists (CCTT) approved Technician & Technologist Profiles.

## Profile of a Certified Engineering/Applied Science Technologist ##

A Certified Engineering Technologist or Applied Science Technologist (hereinafter referred to as the Technologist) is a professional who, through academic training and experience in the application of mathematics and engineering or scientific principles, is capable of assuming respon­sibility and of exercising independent judgment in the field of engineering or applied science technology in which training has been achieved. By virtue of this training and experience, a Technologist is prepared to take final responsibility for all aspects of work within this field of training. 

### Career Opportunities ###

The Technologist may carry out a wide range of complex work processes in the specialty and identified field of technology in which certification was granted. Employment or career opportunities exist in most phases of industry, consulting, business, governmental and public organizations. Typical areas would include design, marketing, sales, estimating, research and development, production control, purchasing, operations and production, testing, quality management, maintenance, customer and field service, management and supervision of projects and people, instruction and teaching. Such work may be independent or in association with other professionals as part of a team. 

### Education and Training ###

The academic training for a Technologist is based upon a core of applied mathematics and engineering/ science fundamentals. The mathematics core would include topics such as differential equations, integration, linear algebra, analytical geometry, trigonometry, statistics and computer related mathematics, permitting the Technologist to use mathematics as a tool in the synthesis of designs or in the analysis of the technical problems of the field of discipline. The engineering and science fundamentals provide a firm base along with mathematics for training in the engineering/applied science, applicable to a particular branch or specialty of technology. The academic and theoretical portion of a program of training is suitably reinforced by laboratory and project experience amounting to approximately one-third of the total program. 

### Certification ###

An individual who successfully completes the examinations of a provincial association, or who graduates from an accredited technologist level program, or who otherwise meets the academic standards established by the certifying body, may on completion of at least two years of acceptable practical experience in an area of work directly related to the area of academic achievement, be certified as an engineering technologist or applied science technologist. 

### Duties and Responsibilities ###

The Technologist uses an applied approach based upon a comprehensive understanding of the field of technology in which certification was granted. The Technologist evaluates assignments, establishes objectives, defines problems and determines procedures and actions to resolve the problems. 

**The Technologist may:**

- design equipment, processes or systems; interpret and prepare specifications, technical drawings or instructions;prepare estimates and manage projects.
- specify tests; conduct non-routine tests; develop proto types; operate pilot plants; trouble-shoot complex equipment; resolve production or construction problems; compile experimental data, or prepare reports.
- supervise, train, coordinate and assume administrative responsibility for the work of others and participate in short and long range planning.
- The Technologist carries out studies, makes calculations, prepares or develops programs, provides instructions, or implements projects. 

The Certified Engineering Technologist or Applied Science Technologist will assume responsibility for his/her work and is at all times bound by a professional code of ethics. He/She will be identified by one of the following certification marks in Manitoba of C.E.T or A.Sc.T. 

## Profile of a Certified Engineering/Applied Science Technician ##

A Certified Engineering Technician or Certified Applied Science Technician (hereinafter referred to as the Technician) is an individual who, through academic training and experience in the application of mathematics and engineering or scientific principles, is capable of accepting responsibility and of exercising judgment in the specialized portion of the field of engineering or applied science technology in which training has been achieved. By virtue of this training and experience, a Technician is often delegated responsibility for aspects of work within this specialized portion of the field of training. 

### Career Opportunities ###

A Technician may carry out a variety of technical work processes in the area of specialization in which certification was granted. Employment or career opportunities exist in many phases of industry, consulting, business, governmental and public organizations. Typical areas would include design, marketing, sales, estimating, research and development, production control, purchasing, operations and production, testing, quality control, maintenance, customer and field service, supervision of projects and people, instruction and training. Such work is usually in association with other professionals as part of a team. 

### Education and Training ###

The academic training for a Technician is based upon a core of applied mathematics and engineering science fundamentals. The mathematics core would include topics such as algebra, geometry, trigonometry, descriptive statistics, computer applications and introductory calculus, to the extent required for the explanation of technical components of the specialized area of training. The Technician will use mathematics as a tool in the solution of the technical problems of his/her specialized field. The engineering and science fundamentals provide a firm base along with mathematics for specialized training which normally invokes empirical rather than analytical solutions to technical problems. The academic and theoretical portion of a program of training is suitably reinforced by laboratory and project experience amounting to approximately one half of the total program. 

### Certification ###

An individual who successfully completes the examinations of a provincial association or who graduates from an accredited technician level program, or who otherwise meets the academic standards established by the certifying body, may on completion of at least two years of acceptable practical experience in an area of work directly related to the area of specialized academic achievement, be registered as a Certified Engineering Technician or Certified Applied Science Technician. 


### Duties and Responsibilities ###

The Technician generally uses a practical approach based upon a detailed understanding of the field of technology in which certification was granted. The Technician examines his/her assignments, objectives and instructions to select procedures and actions to resolve the assigned problem. 

**The Technician may:**

- assist in the design of equipment or systems; assist in the interpretation and preparation or modification of specifications, technical drawings or instructions; prepare estimates and supervise phases of major projects.
- conduct tests; build prototypes or models; operate pilot plants, trouble-shoot equipment; resolve production or construction problems; compile data and reports.
- supervise phases of construction projects; inspect construction projects; conduct tests, surveys or prepare estimates for construction activities.
- trouble-shoot, service, calibrate or supervise the repair or installation of equipment processes or products.

In most cases, this may be as simple as paying a transfer fee. In others, it may entail writing a professional practice exam.

**For certified members from provincial constituent members of CCTT transferring to CTTAM the following is required:**

-     The completion of an [Interprovincial Transfer Form](http://cttam.olasoft.com/uploaded/21/web/docs/transferform.pdf)
-     A transfer fee of $50 as indicated on form
-     A signed Statement of Acknowledgement indicating that the transferee has read and understood the CTTAM Code of Ethics, Bylaws, Act and related Acts from other Associations. Note: This option is available only to transferees that have completed the Professional Practice Exam in their province of origin. 

#### International Transferability and Reciprocity ####

Applicants from the United States, United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Ireland, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia may be eligible for transfer of membership or recognition of academics based on the following reciprocity / transferability agreements:

-    Canadian Council of Technicians and Technologists (CCTT) and the National Institute of Certified Engineering Technologists (NICET) - United States
-    CCTT and the Institute of Engineering Technology (IET) - United Kingdom
-     Sydney Accord
-     Dublin Accord


## Certification Requirements ##

CTTAM Certification is dependent on three elements:

-     Academics
-     Work Experience
-     Professionalism 

#### Academics ####

Academic requirements must be in compliance with the National Technology Benchmarks that are the main accreditation and certification tool for the Canadian Council of Technicians & Technologists (CCTT) provincial members.

Engineering technology or applied science programs that are accredited by the Canadian Technology Accreditation Board (CTAB) meet the academic requirements of the National Technology Benchmarks. As a result, accredited programs do not require academic assessment by the CTTAM Panel of Examiners. Current and past accredited engineering technology programs are listed at www.cctt.ca

Applicants who are graduates of non-accredited technology programs would have their academics reviewed by the Panel of Examiners to determine if the program meets the general and discipline-specific National Technology Benchmarks. To adequately assess non-accredited programs, the Panel of Examiners may require a syllabus or course descriptions and outlines. If the academic program does not meet the benchmark for either technician or technologist, an academic reclassification program for further studies can be requested.

**Academic Self-Assessment**

Applicants of non-accredited programs are encouraged to perform a self-assessment of their academics by comparing their documented academics to the National Technology Benchmarks (NTB) at www.cctt.ca. By reviewing the NTB, applicants can self-assess against the academic standards of their discipline to determine if they wish to apply.

#### Work Experience ####

Work experience requirements for certification include a minimum of two (2) years or 24 months of acceptable technical experience as determined by the Certification Board. The two years of work experience must include:

-     At least six (6) months of experience at a level consistent with the certification level that is to be granted, either Certified Engineering/Applied Science Technician or Technologist.
-     At least one year of work experience in Canada. 

For graduates of technology programs that included a co-op component, the co-op work experience can provide a maximum of six months work experience to the total requirement of 24 months.

The Certification Board reviews the applicant’s work history, detailed current job description and professional reference questionnaires to assess work experience and determine the classification.

Although Canadians use the terms 'Technician' and ‘Technologist’ generally to describe many different occupations, Engineering/Applied Science Technicians and Technologists are very distinct individuals. These are the people who, through a high degree of specialized training may use, test, repair, design, analyze and problem solve in a broad range of applied science and engineering areas. They are employed in a vast range of economic sectors, from manufacturing to telecommunications.

To learn more about the differences between Technicians and Technologists refer to the detailed CCTT approved Technician & Technologist Profiles.

#### Professionalism ####

Certified members must be of good character and are bound by the CTTAM Code of Ethics and Bylaws and The Certified Applied Science Technologist Act.

The professional reference questionnaires completed by the applicant’s references contain questions to aid in the assessment of good character by the Certification Board.

All applicants for certification must complete the CTTAM Professional Practice Exam. The purpose of this exam is to ensure that certified members are familiar with the CTTAM Code of Ethics and Bylaws and the Certified Applied Science Technologist Act.

Unethical conduct reflects adversely on all certified technicians and technologists. One distinguishing feature of any profession is that membership in that profession entails an ethical obligation to temper one’s selfish pursuit of economic success by adhering to standards of conduct that could not be enforced either by legal fiat or through the discipline of the market.” Ethical decisions are not always obvious or easy. Ambiguity, incomplete information, points of view and conflicting objectives can make an ethical decision difficult. Written standards, codes of ethics and a well developed decision making process make ethical decisions easier.


## Work Experience and References ##

Work experience requirements for certification include a minimum of two (2) years or 24 months of acceptable technical experience as determined by the Certification Board.

The two years of work experience must include:

-     At least six (6) months of experience at a level consistent with the certification level that is to be granted, either Certified Engineering/Applied Science Technician or Technologist.
-     At least one year of work experience in Canada.

For graduates of technology programs that included a co-op component, the co-op work experience can provide a maximum of six months work experience to the total requirement of 24 months.

Applicants with foreign technical work experience must acquire a minimum of twelve months of technical work experience in Canada to be considered for certification. The foreign work experience can provide a credit of one year to the two year work experience requirement.

The Certification Board reviews the applicant’s work history, detailed current job description and professional reference questionnaires to assess work experience.

### Work Experience Documentation ###

For the Certification Board to complete the work experience assessment the applicant must provide:

-     The names and contact information for three[ professional references](http://www.cttam.com/site/experience?nav=02#ref)
-     A [work history](http://www.cttam.com/site/experience?nav=02#hist) of technical work experience
-     [Detailed current job description](http://www.cttam.com/site/experience?nav=02#desc) signed on each page by the applicant’s immediate supervisor.

### Professional References ###

Applicants are asked to provide the names, full mailing addresses, professional designations and business affiliations of at least three persons (preferably C.E.T., A.Sc.T., C.Tech., or P.Eng.) who have a good knowledge of their character, capabilities and technical work experience in Canada. It is not mandatory that all three references have designations. However, at least one reference should have a professional designation.

It is recommended that the references have worked with the applicant for a minimum of six months. If the applicant has the required two years of work experience but has been in the current job for less than six months, the applicant should delay applying until at least six months of current employment has been attained.

Unless the applicant is self-employed, one reference should be the current and immediate supervisor.

The Certification Board may consider applications with only two professional references, providing that the applicant has given an explanation for this situation.

CTTAM will mail Professional Reference Questionnaires to the three references. All three completed professional reference questionnaires must be returned before the Certification Board will review the application. It is the obligation of the applicant to follow-up with their references to ensure that the completed questionnaires are returned to CTTAM. All information is strictly confidential between the reference and the Association.

Applicants who do not have the required work experience, such as recent graduates or newcomers to Canada without Canadian technical work experience, do not provide professional references.

### Work History ###

Work history is Part B of the application form. The work history must be outlined on a separate page with a heading of Part B - Work History and the name of the applicant.

All applicants, except for recent graduates of technology programs, must complete Part B - Work History. Immigrants would include foreign work experience.

The work history should follow the format of a chronological listing of all past technical work experience that includes for each employment position:

-     Dates of employment (month/year),
-     Job Title,
-     Company Name,
-     Location,
-     Job Description,
-     Detailed Technical Experience,
-     Responsibilities and/or achievements.

Graduates of technology programs that included co-op work experience should indicate which jobs were co-op positions. Co-op work experience can be assigned a maximum of six months work experience towards the total requirement of 24 months.

Resumes generally are not written in a style to provide sufficient information about technical work history. It is recommended that a work history be submitted as outlined above.

A well-described work history is very critical for applicants who have been in their current position for less than two years.

### Detailed Current Job Description ###

The detailed current job description is Part C of the application form. The detailed current job description must be outlined on a separate page with a heading of Part C – Detailed Current Job Description and the name of the applicant.

The Certification Board recommends that applicants write a unique job description that describes their work rather than using a company job posting description. In most cases, the company descriptions are too general and do not provide sufficient technical detail from which to make a fair work experience assessment.

The Detailed Current Job Description follows the following outline:

1.     Job Title, Department, Company, Location, Supervisor's Title & Name, Date of Appointment.
1.     Describe the various functions of the job in order of importance.
1.     Indicate the percentage of total time spent on each function.
1.     Specify how you influence or direct the work of others, indicating the numbers and qualifications of people involved.
1.     Describe the manner in which your work is assigned and evaluated.
1.     Describe examples of projects with which you are typically involved and/or relevant information on equipment used, test procedures, etc.

Ensure that each page of your job description and the affidavit on page 2 of the application or reclassification form are signed by your immediate supervisor.

### Profiles for Technicians & Technologists ###

Although Canadians use the terms 'Technician' and 'Technologist' generally to describe many different occupations, Engineering/Applied Science Technicians and Technologists are very distinct individuals. These are the people who, through a high degree of specialized training may use, test, repair, design, analyze and problem solve in a broad range of applied science and engineering areas. They are employed in a vast range of economic sectors, from manufacturing to telecommunications.

### Engineering / Applied Science Technician ###

A technician generally uses a practical approach based on a detailed understanding of the field of technology being practiced. Many of the duties of the technician are similar to that of a technologist and other professionals but typically only in a very selective area of specialization.

While some duties of the technician may be similar to skilled craft or trades persons, these duties would not normally be of a routine nature and would only apply to sophisticated equipment or processes. A technician is bound by a professional code of ethics.

**The technician may:**

-     examine assignments, objectives and instructions to select procedures and actions for resolving the assigned problem;
-     assist in the design of equipment or systems, assist in the interpretation and preparation or modification of specifications, technical drawings or instructions, prepare estimates and supervise phases of major projects;
-     conduct tests, build prototypes or models, operate pilot plants, trouble-shoot equipment, resolve production or construction problems, compile data and reports;
-     supervise phases of construction projects, inspect construction projects, conduct tests, surveys or prepare estimates for construction activities;
-     install, calibrate, maintain, trouble-shoot, repair or supervise the repair and installation of equipment processes or products;
-     provide support for operations activities including supervision of operations or operation-related activities such as quality assurance, production control and maintenance;
-     provide support in laboratory environments by conducting experiments, conducting tests or servicing complex equipment in support of research and development, quality control or academic activities;
-     supervise, train, and coordinate the activities of others.

### Engineering / Applied Science Technologist ###

A technologist approaches the solution of problems in applied science and engineering technology with a comprehensive understanding of a specific field of technology. A technologist is bound by a professional code of ethics.

The technologist may:

-     evaluate assignments, establishes objectives, defines problems, and decides upon procedures and actions for their accomplishment or resolution;
-     design equipment, processes or systems, interpret and prepare specifications, technical drawings or instructions, prepare estimates and manage projects;
-     specify tests, conduct non-routine tests, develop prototypes, operate (larger) pilot plants, troubleshoot complex equipment, resolve production or construction difficulties, compile experimental data and prepare reports;
-     supervise, train, coordinate, and assume administrative responsibility for the work of others;
-     participate in short and long range planning; and
-     carry out studies, make calculations, prepare or develop programs, provide instructions and implement projects.

The detailed CCTT approved profiles for Technician and Technologist can be found at Profiles for Technicians and Technologists or A comparative chart between Technicians and Technologists.

## Law and Ethics Examination ##

### The Law and Ethics Exam Certification Requirement ###

All applicants for certification must complete and pass the CTTAM Law and Ethics Exam.

### Registering to write the Law and Ethics Exam ###

Applicants for membership / certification can register to write the Law and Ethics Exam after they have submitted a complete application and paid the application fee.

Associates must write the Exam prior to seeking reclassification to full membership.

Applicants who are applying without the required work experience for certification can delay writing the Law and Ethics Exam until they are applying for reclassification for full membership / certification. Applicants who are newcomers with English as an additional language may write the Exam when they have reached an English language benchmark of 6 for both reading and writing.

The Law and Ethics Exam with scheduled examination dates is posted on the Home Page under Forms and Downloads. Applicants who live outside of Winnipeg can make arrangements to have the exam proctored in their community. Instructions for this process are on the Law and Ethics Exam registration form.

The application fee includes the Professional Practice Manual, as well as all the costs of administering and assessing the examination and all of the committee reviews.

### Professional Practice Manual ###

Applicants who bring their Applications and documentation to the CTTAM office will be given the study guide at that time. Applicants who live outside of Winnipeg and have mailed their application will have the Professional Practice Manual mailed to them. Applicants in and around Winnipeg are asked to pick up the Professional Practice Manual at the CTTAM office.

### CTTAM Policy and the Law and Ethics Exam ###

To stress the importance of professionalism, CTTAM policy dictates that applicants who have not completed the exam will not be recommended for certification.

Applicants who do not complete the Law and Ethics Exam within the 12 month deadline will be required to reapply for certification or made an Associate.

Applicants who are recommended for the Associate classification are not required to complete the exam until they are making application for reclassification. Even so, Associates are eligible to complete the Law and Ethics Exam at any time.

### The Purpose and Content of the Law and Ethics Exam ###

The purpose of the Law and Ethics Examination  is to ensure that certified members are familiar with the CTTAM Code of Ethics and Bylaws and the Certified Applied Science Technologist Act, as well as sections of The Engineering and Geoscientific Professions Act:

Unethical conduct reflects adversely on all certified technicians and technologists. One distinguishing feature of any profession is that membership in that profession entails an ethical obligation to temper one's selfish pursuit of economic success by adhering to standards of conduct that could not be enforced either by legal fiat or through the discipline of the market. Ethical decisions are not always obvious or easy. Ambiguity, incomplete information, points of view and conflicting objectives can make an ethical decision difficult. Ethical decisions are easier to make with written standards, codes of ethics and a well developed decision- making process.

The Law and Ethics Exam is an open book exam containing a variety of questions including True/False, Multiple Choice and short answer case studies written within a three hour time limit.

## Academic Requirements and Accredited Programs ##

**National Technology Benchmarks**

Academic requirements must be in compliance with the National Technology Benchmarks that are the main accreditation and certification tool for the Canadian Council of Technicians & Technologists (CCTT) provincial constituent members.

Engineering technology or applied science programs that are accredited by the Canadian Technology Accreditation Board (CTAB) meet the academic requirements of the National Technology Benchmarks. As a result, accredited programs do not require academic assessment by the CTTAM Panel of Examiners.

### Nationally Accredited Programs ###

Current and past accredited engineering / applied science technology programs are listed under Accreditation at www.cctt.ca

### Academic Documentation ###

The required academic documentation is Part A of the CTTAM application form. The academics must be on a separate page with a heading of Part A - Academic Documentation and the name of the applicant.

Applicants are required to:

Submit a chronological list of all schooling to date using the following categories:

1.  Post Secondary Education - List using the following headings: School Name, Location, Dates in attendance (from/to), Diploma/Certificate achieved

2. Continuing Professional Development & Part-tme Education - List using the following headings:
    School Name, Location, Subject/Name of Course, Dates (from/to), Hours of instruction, Supervised Exams
    (Yes/No) 

	-     Submit originals of all diplomas or certificates and an original or notarized copy of transcript of marks.
	-     Please make photocopies of all of your academic documents to submit with your application.
	-     Original documents will be returned.
	-     Foreign language documents MUST be accompanied by a notarized English translation.
	-     Graduates of foreign and non-accredited programs should submit a detailed syllabus or course outline obtained from your educational institute. If you do not have a syllabus, discuss this matter with the CTTAM Registrar. 

*It is recommended that applications are brought in person to the CTTAM office so that original documents can be returned immediately.

### Academic Assessment ###

Applicants who are graduates of non-accredited technology programs will have their academics reviewed by the Panel of Examiners to determine if the program meets the general and discipline-specific National Technology Benchmarks for either Technician or Technologist. To adequately assess non-accredited programs, the Panel of Examiners may require the applicant to provide a syllabus or course descriptions and outlines.

The Panel of Examiners will assess and classify academics at the levels of Technologist, Technician or Associate. Applicants who receive an academic assessment of insufficient will not be registered with CTTAM.

If the applicant's academic program does not meet the benchmark for either a technician or technologist academic classification, the applicant can request a reclassification program for further studies.

All applicants who have completed a non-accredited program assessed as academically equivalent to Technologist will be required to submit a Technical Report to fully meet the academic requirements for Technologist. For more information on Technical Reports refer to the document Procedure for Writing a Technical Report.

### Self-Assessment against the National Technology Benchmarks ###

Applicants of non-accredited programs are encouraged to perform a self-assessment of their academics by comparing their documented academics to the National Technology Benchmarks (NTB) at www.cctt.ca By reviewing the NTB, applicants can self-assess against the standards of their discipline to determine if they wish to apply.
