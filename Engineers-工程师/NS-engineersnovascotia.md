## 国家考试 ##


### NPPE ###

NPPE是一种闭卷考试，考试内容涉及道德、义务和法律概念，这些是专业工程师执业所必须具备的。《加拿大工程执业许可》（加拿大工程师协会指导方针）要求：所有工程师都必须通过NPPE，才可以成为加拿大注册专业工程师。**建议：**最好获得24个月的工程工作经验之后，再参加NPPE。

 
自2015年10月起，NPPE将采取计算机考试的形式。详见：[NPPE计算机考试信息 - PDF](https://secure.engineersnovascotia.ca/files/files/NPPE%20Computer%20Based%20Testing%20migration.pdf) 
 
目前你可以通过APEGA购买[NPPE实践考试](https://nppepractice.ysasecure.com/)。

只有会员或者有注册编号的申请者才可以报考NPPE。你须登陆**Nova Scotia工程师协会**个人账号注册报考NPPE。一旦注册成功，你会收到来自**Nova Scotia工程师协会**的一封确认电子邮件。

### 专业实践讲习班 ###

自2016年起，Nova Scotia工程师协会每年都会在Halifax举办两次专业实践讲习班，讲习时间为1天，讲习内容涉及法律和道德，将有助于你准备NPPE。有关讲习班以及考试日期，见[这里](https://secure.engineersnovascotia.ca/files/files/PP%20Workshop%20%26%20NPP%20Exam%20Dates.docx)。

>## National Examinations ##


>### National Professional Practice Exam (NPPE) ###

>This is a closed-book exam on the ethics, obligations, and legal concepts that are part of practicing as a professional engineer. The Engineers Canada guideline "Admission to the Practice of Engineering in Canada", requires all engineers to complete a professional practice examination before they can become licensed as professional engineers in Canada.  It is recommended that you have 24 months of engineering experience before you  write this exam.
 
>Beginning in October 2015 the NPPE will be a computer based exam.  [NPPE Computer Based Testing Information - PDF](https://secure.engineersnovascotia.ca/files/files/NPPE%20Computer%20Based%20Testing%20migration.pdf) 
 
>You can now purchase an  [NPPE Practice Exam](https://nppepractice.ysasecure.com/) through the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta (APEGA).
 
>Only Members or Applicants with a registration number may apply to take the NPPE.   You will need to login to your Engineers Nova Scotia account to register for the NPPE.   If your registration is successful, you will receive a confirmation email from Engineers Nova Scotia. 

>### Professional Practice Workshop ###

>Engineers Nova Scotia hosts a Professional Practice Workshop in Halifax twice a year beginning in 2016.   The one day optional workshop on law and ethics will help you prepare for the National Professional Practice Exam (NPPE).
