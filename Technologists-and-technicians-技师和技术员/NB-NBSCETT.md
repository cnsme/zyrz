## 关于 NBSCETT - 飞出国 ##

NBSCETT于1968年成立，是新不伦瑞克省工程/应用科学技术员和技师的独立认证机构。认证是由认证委员会完成的，其中包括来自不同学科的技术专家小组。认证协会向工程/应用科学技术员和技师评估申请，并推荐认证，且这些技术员和技师的教育和工作经验都符合认可的国家标准。

NBSCETT会授予"CTech"和“PTech”这样的名称，这两个名称是在工程/应用科学技术上获得的成就的标志，并且只有得到充分认证的成员才能使用至两个名称，且受到法律的保护。认证协会授予的其他名称还有‘CET’、Certified Engineering Technician和‘CET’，还有 Certified Engineering Technologist。经过CCTT分支-省认证协会的努力，这些名称得到了加拿大境内的雇主和其他工程类专家的认可。

>Established in 1968, NBSCETT is New Brunswick's independent certifying body for engineering/applied science technicians and technologists.  Certification is accomplished by a Certification Board which includes a panel of technical experts from varied disciplines.  The Board evaluates applications and recommends certification to the Society Council of engineering/applied science technicians and technologists who meet recognized national benchmarks in education and experience.
>
NBSCETT confers the designations "CTech" and “PTech” which are symbols of achievement in engineering/applied science technology and are legally protected for use only by fully certified members.  Other designations which have been granted by the Society are ‘CET’, Certified Engineering Technician and ‘CET’, Certified Engineering Technologist. The designations are recognized across Canada by employers and other engineering professionals through the efforts of provincial associations that make up the Canadian Council of Technicians and Technologists (CCTT).

>Citizen and Immigration Canada - Services for newcomers

>The designation granted by NBSCETT recognizing an individual’s professional status worldwide, PTech or CTech are protected trademarks for exclusive use of the Constituent Member organizations of the Canadian Council of Technicians and Technologists (CCTT). Only certified members in good standing may use these titles and proclaim themselves as Certified Technicians or Professional Technologists.

>Other designations which have been granted by NBSCETT and are still recognized worldwide are Certified Engineering Technician (CET), Certified Engineering Technologists (CET) and Applied Science Technologist (AScT).

在大专院校一完成国家认可的两年或三年的应用科学或工程技术课程，毕业生就可以加入协会，成为 “Technology Graduate In Training” (TGIT)。这种会员分类认可毕业生有为以后申请认证会员的学历条件。尽管获得一年的相关学科的具体的技术经验也需要认证的会员申请，但是TGIT也能够参与职业发展、社会和就业福利、亲民福利互动以及社会的努力。所有的Canadian Technology Accreditation Board的毕业生获得授权学习新不伦瑞克大学的应用科学和工程技术课程，并且完成了协会的职业道德实践课程及考试，因此不需要再申请认证会员时进行进一步的测试。

所有的完成学校课程和考试的，但仍未毕业的申请人，必须完成职业道德实践课程及考试，这也是申请协会认证会员过程的一部分。在应用学科或工程技术大学的合作项目中获得的具体的技术工作经验会是24个月的工作经验要求的其中一部分。对学科具体技术工作经验要求的目的是，确保申请人通过专业学习后能够遵循从中学到的应用科学/工程技术的原则，并且至少能够获得实际应用的经验和了解车间要求的程序。

>Upon successful completion of a national accredited post-secondary two or three-year applied science or engineering technology program, the graduate in New Brunswick may join the Society as a “Technology Graduate In Training” (TGIT).This membership category acknowledges the person has the prerequisite academics for future certified membership application. While garnering the 24 (twenty-four) months of relevant discipline specific technical experience also required for certified membership application, TGIT’s are able to participate in the professional development, social, employment benefits and affinity benefit activities and endeavours of the Society.
>
>All graduates of the Canadian Technology Accreditation Board’s nationally accredited applied science and engineering technology programs of the New Brunswick Community Colleges have completed the Society’s Professional Practice and Ethics course and examination, therefore not requiring additional testing in the certified membership application. All applicants who have not graduated with having completed the course and examination must write the Professional Practice and Ethics examinations as part of the Society’s certified membership application process. Discipline specific technical work experience during an applied science or engineering technology college co-op program may be accepted as a portion of the total twenty-four months requirement. The purpose of the discipline specific technical work experience requirement is to ensure the applicant can apply the principles of applied science/engineering technology gained through academic study, and has the minimum experience in the practical applications and procedures required in the workplace.

协会认证委员会会逐个地严肃对待每个认证会员的申请。

在申请认证会员时，要审查学历的确认、技术工作履历的证明、申请人的推荐信和多个学科的认证会员身份。
认证委员会会审查个人判断力和责任工作的具体复杂学科的技术工作简历以及在车间的创造力、其他的职业发展和对推荐信的反馈。


>Each application for certified membership is dealt with strictly individually by the Society’s Certification Board. 
Following confirmation of academics, and receipt of technical work experience resumés and confirmed by the applicant’s references, certified members of a variety of disciplines participate in the review of certified membership applications. The Certification Board reviews the technical experience resumé for discipline specific complexity of work individual judgement and responsibility required, and the initiative in the workplace, additional professional development and the responses from the references.
