## 加拿大建筑师考试 (ExAC) ##

加拿大省/地区建筑师许可机构在各自管辖的地区负责保障公共安全，提供建筑师专业技术服务。为了确保所有建筑师刚刚进入建筑行业时以及在整个职业生涯中都具备合格的能力，相关机构已经建立许多检测机制，许可/注册考试就是其中一种。

AAA、OAA以及QAQ都同意在加拿大开发一种新型许可/注册考试，可以完全控制其发展、更新和注册。

加拿大所有的许可机构都已经采用了ExAC，它可以检测出实习生在实习期间获得的最低能力，确保保障公共安全，提供建筑师专业技术服务。ExAC自2008年起开始实行。

### ExAC目标

ExAC是一个以经验为基础的考试。OAA、OAQ和AAA这三个机构建立ExAC之后，从中选出了一批有经验的建筑师，这些建筑师制定、审查并批准了一套《一般目标与具体目标》，而这套《一般目标与具体目标》就是ExAC的考试依据。这些目标明确了哪些领域和水平的知识可以证明在建筑专业的能力。应试者准备考试时最好下载 [这个文件](fileadmin/documents/pdf/fr/objectifs_en_2015.pdfobjectifs_en_2015.pdf (758 KB)） 熟悉一下这些目标。

#### ExAC科目

**科目1**

- 设计
- 场地和环境分析
- 成本管理
- 协调工程系统
- 方案设计
- 设计开发

**科目2 **

- Code Research (NBC 2010 Edition)

**科目3 **

- 毕业设计

**科目4 **

- 投标和合同谈判
- 建设阶段 – 办公室
- 建设阶段 – 场地
- 项目管理

### ExAC基础（国际标准）

许可机构开发ExAC时，首先选择创造一个法语和英语考试，这样符合许可考试在开发、管理、评分和报告方面的国际标准。

在整个流程中，考试顾问也是开发团队成员。

考试顾问指导加拿大工程师开发与验证：

- 开发/更新[ExAC目标](en/preparation/objectifs.html#c72 "Opens internal link in current window")
- 以具体目标依据编写/更新试题
- 以简洁为准则评估试题的总体质量
- 评估试题的难度系数
- 在编写试题时，证明符合具体目标和实践标准

此外，加拿大工程师将进行这些问题的测试。试题的质量将根据收集的数据来确定，分数线将在实施标准设置流程之后再确定。更多内容：[技术和统计报告](en/examen/rapport.html#c75 "Opens internal link in current window")。

### 技术和统计报告 ###

技术和统计报告，由加拿大建筑师考试委员会准备，每年都会更新。这些报告使用两种官方语言发布，主要介绍考试的发展、管理和评分的步骤和方法。ExAC每年都会发布一个新版本报告，还会准备一份技术和统计报告摘要。

>## The Examination for Architects in Canada (ExAC) ##

>The Provincial/Territorial Architectural Licensing Authorities in Canada (Licensing Authorities) have the mandate to ensure both public safety and professional skilled delivery of architectural services in their respective jurisdictions.  Mechanisms have been established to ensure the competence of architects, both when they enter the profession and throughout their professional careers.  The licensing/registration examination is one of these mechanisms.

>The Alberta Association of Architects (AAA), the Ontario Association of Architects (OAA) and the Ordre des architectes du Québec (OAQ) agreed to develop a new Canadian licensing/registration examination, over which they would have complete control, including its development, updates and administration. 

>The Examination for Architects in Canada (ExAC) which, to date, all of the Canadian Licensing Authorities have adopted, was developed to test the minimum standards of competency acquired by an Intern during the Internship period, to ensure both public safety and the professional and skilled delivery of architectural services.
The ExAC has been offered since 2008.


>### ExAC Objectives and Sections

>The ExAC is an experience based examination. The foundation of the examination is based upon a set of General and Specific Objectives which were developed, reviewed and approved at the outset by a selected group of experienced architects from the three founding parties of the ExAC (OAA, OAQ and AAA). These objectives define the areas and level of knowledge which are used to demonstrate the competencies of the architectural profession. It is suggested that candidates [download this document](fileadmin/documents/pdf/fr/objectifs_en_2015.pdf "objectifs_en_2015.pdf (758 KB)") and familiarize themselves with these objectives while preparing for the examination.

>#### ExAC Sections

>**Section 1**

>- Programming
- Site and Environmental Analysis
- Cost Management
- Coordinating Engineering Systems
- Schematic Design
- Design Development

>**Section 2**

>- Code Research (NBC 2010 Edition)

>**Section 3**

>- Final Project

>**Section 4**

>- Bidding and Contract Negotiations
- Construction Phase – Office
- Construction Phase – Site
- Project Management

>### ExAC based on international standards

>The first priority of the Licensing Authorities that developed the ExAC, was to create an examination in French and English, that meets international standards for the development, administration, scoring and reporting of licensing examinations. 

>Test Consultants were part of the development teams throughout the entire process.

>Development and validation teams of Canadian architects, are guided by the Test Consultants to:

>- Develop/update the [ExAC objectives](en/preparation/objectifs.html#c72 "Opens internal link in current window")
- Write/update questions based on the specific objectives
- Validate and review the questions to ensure appropriateness of content for all Canadian jurisdictions
- Evaluate question's overall quality in terms of clarity
- Evaluate levels of difficulty, and
- Verify adherence to specific objectives and to standards of practice in the writting of examination questions.

>In addition, the items are being tested by Canadian architects.  Data is collected to determine the quality of the questions and a standard setting procedure is conducted to establish the cut score. For more information consult the [Technical and Statistical Report](en/examen/rapport.html#c75 "Opens internal link in current window").


>### Technical and Statistical Report ###

>The Committee for the Examination for Architects in Canada prepares technical and statistical reports and updates them annually. These reports are published in both official languages. The Technical and Statistical Report describes the steps and methods used in the development, administration and scoring of the examination. It also provides statistics about results and scoring process. A report is produced for each annual version of the EXAC. A summary of the Technical and Statistical Report is also prepared.

-   [General and Specific Objectives of the ExAC](en/preparation/objectifs.html "Opens internal link in current window")
-   [References and Resources](en/preparation/references00.html "Opens internal link in current window")

>There is currently no preparation course or study guide approved by the ExAC committee.

>### Preparation Guide

>[The Preparation Guide](fileadmin/documents/pdf/fr/guide_preparation_en_2015.pdf "guide_preparation_en_2015.pdf (797 KB)") for the ExAC describes the procedures regulating the ExAC, including Intern conduct during the examination session and the items you are permitted to bring into the examination room. You must read the Guide carefully before you register for the ExAC and before the examination session. Each year, a new version of the Guide is published on the website on the opening date of the registration period.

>When you register for the ExAC, you must declare that you have read and will adhere to the conditions as set out in the Preparation Guide.

>## Results ##

>The examination results will be mailed to Interns by mid-February following the ExAC session, in  the form of a transcript issued by his/her Licensing Authority. The results for each section of the ExAC will be identified as pass or fail. The examinee will not receive a score or a percentage. In the case of a fail score, feedback is given to the examinee on which General Objectives he/she may need to focus on as his/her results indicate he/she may be weak in these areas. No further details will be provided to examinees.

>A cut score is used to identify pass/fail results and is determined by a panel of Architects with the examination consultants after the administration of the examination. The consultants employ various statistical models, designs and analyses for the determination of cut scores and to ensure that it is valid and reliable. The cut score is not published.

>In accordance with Section 18 of the Preparation Guide, you are allowed three consecutive attempts to achieve a pass on all four sections of the ExAC. 

>For additional information about the marking and scoring of the ExAC, please read the Technical and Statistical Report and the FAQ.
