The time it takes to complete this step depends on you, so gather your required documents as quickly as possible.

>#### Academic assessment ####

>The association will look at your academic documents—degrees, transcripts or certificates—to determine if you need to complete any additional courses or take any examinations. In most cases, your degree and transcripts must be sent directly from your institution to the provincial/territorial engineering association.  If your academic documents are not in the language of practice of the province/territory in which you wish to work, you must also provide certified translations. 

 
>#### Work experience and references assessment ####

>The association assesses your work experience record and reference letters to make sure you have completed the required minimum of four years of engineering work experience (including one year of supervised engineering experience in a Canadian environment).

>The format and requirements of your work experience record will vary from one engineering association to the next, but generally should include your employer’s name, the position you held, your supervisor’s name and a description of the engineering work you did.  Your work record must be approved by a professional engineer (P.Eng.). Check with the engineering association you will apply to for more information on work experience requirements. 

>You do not have to wait until you have one year of supervised engineering experience in Canada before submitting your application.


>#### Language competency assessment ####

>You must meet the language requirements of the province/territory you wish to work in. Language competency means that you are able to communicate effectively with the public, colleagues, employers, and others.  Communication should be clear and professional, both orally and in writing. The provincial/territorial associations use a variety of methods to assess language competency.


>#### Character assessment ####

>The association you apply to for licensure will ensure that you have observed the values of truth, honesty and trustworthiness so that you can uphold the reputation of the profession as you work as a professional engineer (P.Eng.) in Canada.


>#### Professional Practice Examination ####

>The mandatory Professional Practice Examination (PPE) tests your knowledge of ethics and Canadian law as it relates to engineering, including contract, patent, trademark and copyright laws. This exam is offered at least twice a year.  Check with the provincial/territorial association in which you wish to practice engineering for more information.


>#### Licensure granted ####

>When you have successfully completed all the steps in the application process, the association you apply to for licensure will give you your official certificate, a letter of confirmation and other items.
