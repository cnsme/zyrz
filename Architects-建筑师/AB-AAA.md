### 国外培训建筑师 - 飞出国 ###

在加拿大，经验丰富的外国建筑师（BEFA）项目简化了国外建筑师获得许可证的过程。

BEFA项目按照泛加拿大实践能力标准评估国外建筑师的基本工作经历。满足项目标准的外国建筑师可以经过一个程序申请BEFA证。这个程序包括在线自我评估和注册建筑师面试。

如果想了解更多内容请访问 http://www.cacb-ccca.ca/befa或联系befacoord@cacb.ca.

一旦申请人成功完成BEFA过程,他们将被授予一个BEFA证书。当CACB颁发给你证书之后，证书可以作为推荐信，等同于在加拿大教育经历、工作经历和由省或领地的许可证机构制定的考试标准。
有了这个证之后，你可以向省或领地的协会申请你已经注册的许可证。

> ### Foreign-Trained Architects ###
> 
> The Broadly Experienced Foreign Architects (BEFA) program streamlines the process for foreign-trained architects to become certified for licensure in Canada. 
> 
> The BEFA program assesses broadly based experience of foreign architects against Pan-Canadian standards of competency for practice in Canada. Foreign architects who meet the Program eligibility requirements can apply for BEFA Certification through a process which consists of an on-line self-assessment and an interview with licensed architects. 
> 
> For more information, please visit http://www.cacb-ccca.ca/befa or contact the BEFA Coordinator at befacoord@cacb.ca. 
> 
> Once an applicant has successfully completed the BEFA process, they will be granted a BEFA certificate. When BEFA Certification is issued by CACB, it will serve as a recommendation for recognition as an equivalent to successful completion of the Canadian Education, Experience, and Examination Standards that are in place for licensure by a provincal or territorial licensing body. With the BEFA Certificate, you can apply for licensure to the Provincial/Territorial Association you have chosen to register with.
