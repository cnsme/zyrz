## 实习建筑师项目 - 飞出国 ##

实习建筑师项目是一个国际性项目，他可以确保加拿大未来的建筑师为就业做最好的准备。为了促进正规教育向建筑师注册/执照之间的过度，所以开展了这个作为中间过度的项目。

该项目可确保实习建筑师获得了足够的经验以满足所需的实践技能和建筑标准来维护公众健康和安全。

AAPEI负责管理该岛实习建筑师的项目。所有的省协会要求实习建筑师至少在建筑特定领域有5600个小时的工作经验。实习建筑师负责在加拿大经验记录薄上记录持续的工作时间。记录薄须由用人单位证明，由导师审查并经协会批准。

此外实习建筑师需要通过加拿大建筑师考试。

加拿大建筑师考试（EXAC）主要测试在实习期间实习建筑师所需能力的最低标准，以确保公共安全和建筑业人才和技能的输送质量。

EXAC是法语或英语考试，符合管理、评分和许可证考试报告的国际标准。

> ## Intern Architect Program ##
> 
> The Intern Architect Program (IAP) is a national program, which ensures that future Canadian architects are best prepared for possible practice. To facilitate the transition between formal education and architectural registration / licensure – an internship process was put in place.
> 
> This program ensures that the intern architect gains enough experience to meet recognized standards of practical skill and practice architecture in a way that protects the health and safety of the public.
> 
> AAPEI administers the program for Island intern architects. All provincial associations require that an intern architect gains a minimum of 5600 hours of work experience in specified areas of architectural practice. The intern architect is responsible for maintaining a continuous record of this work experience in the Canadian Experience Record Book, which is certified by the employer, reviewed with a mentor, and approved by the association.
> 
> In addition, the intern architect is required to pass the Examination for Architects in Canada.
> 
> The Examination for Architects in Canada (ExAC)tests the minimum standards of competency acquired by an Intern Architect during the Internship period, to ensure both public safety and the professional and skilled delivery of architectural services.
> 
> ExAC is an examination developed in French and English, that meets international standards for the development, administration, scoring and reporting of licensing examinations.
