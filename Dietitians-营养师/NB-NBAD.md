## Qualifications… ##
要成为营养师需要完成以下三步：
 
**两个预备阶段：**

- 教育
- 实习经验


**在省级饮食监管机构登记才能实习**

1. 要成为营养师的第一步是获得修完食品和营养专业学分的学士学位，且该大学能为加拿大的营养师提供认证的营养教育课程。
2. 第二步是要成功完成加拿大营养师认证的规定的实践经验课程。
3. 成为注册营养师的最后一步就是在你有工作意向的省份的一个监管机构进行注册。申请人要获得注册资格的话，大部分省份都会要求其成功通过加拿大营养注册考试Canadian Dietetic Registration Examination (CDRE)。
