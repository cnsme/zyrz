### 准备材料和辅助性文件 Preparation & Pre-Arrival Supports - 飞出国 ###

有正式牙科专业背景的个人，要移民加拿大，需联系移民省份牙医助理监管机构。牙医助理监管机构与其他国家之间没有牙医助理职业的互认协议。所有申请人必须通过全国牙医助理考试委员会笔试和临床执业评估。

可以在海外进行注册吗？

是的，该过程可以而且应该在海外进行。

注册流程描述和居住要求:

- 申请人需要给所申请地牙医助理监管人员发送电子邮件。DARA会为申请人提供安大略省3个认可的认证评估服务，如国际资质评估机构IQAS、卑诗省国际认证评估服务ICES和世界教育服务WES。参加认证考试没有居住要求限制，但是，申请人必须身在加拿大，才能参加此考试。

资料需要翻译吗？

- 所有资料都需要翻译，可以在加拿大境外完成翻译，并由加拿大公证员或监誓员进行公证。驻世界各国的加拿大使馆工作人员均持有该证，需要将该认证交给加拿大考试委员会。

提交给加拿大全国牙医助理考试委员会（NDAEB）的材料必须是已公证的、内容真实的成绩单、学历证书、结婚证等，并且要翻译成英文或法文。NDAEB只接受上述三个机构提供的公证材料。然而，如果申请人已向加拿大全国牙医考试委员会（NDEB）提交申请并被允许参加牙科考试，NDAEB将认可这些报告，可以取代ICES、IQAS和WES认证报告。已通过NDEB审核流程的国外受训申请人仍需要提交真实的学历记录材料，并由加拿大律师、公证员宣誓公证。除加拿大学历外， 经加拿大牙科协会（ACFD）审核认可的国外受训牙医可参加加拿大大学的牙科对等教育项目。这些申请人可以通过参加ACFD考试， 第三年进入加拿大牙科教育项目， 完成3年或4年的牙科教育， 就可以毕业并满足NDAEB考试要求。他们必须将已公证的真实学业成绩单和被ACFD录取的证明材料提交给NDAEB, 进行资格审核。

> Individuals with a formal background in the dental profession who are considering immigration to Canada should contact the Dental Assisting Regulatory Authority in their preferred destination. There are no Mutual Recognition Agreements between the Dental Assisting Regulatory Authorities and any other country relative to the dental assisting profession. All applicants are required to successfully complete the National Dental Assisting Examining Board written examination and Clinical Practice Evaluation.
> 
> Can the licensing process be started overseas?
> 
> Yes, the process can and should be started overseas.
> 
> Provide a description of the process and any residency requirements.
> 
> - The applicant should email the dental assisting regulator located in their preferred local. The DARA will direct the applicant to one of the three approved credential evaluation services, such as the International Qualifications Assessment Agency (IQAS), International Credential Evaluation Service (ICES) in BC and World Education Service (WES) in Ontario. There are no residency requirements in order to participate in the credentialing examinations; however the applicant will need to be physically present in Canada in order to participate in examinations.
> 
> Do documents need to be translated?
> 
>    -  All documents need to be translated. While the translations can be done overseas, the documents need to be notarized by a Canadian Notary Public or Commissioner of Oath. Employees in Canadian Embassies around the world hold this certification. These credentials will then be ready to present to the examining board in Canada.
> 
> The NDAEB documentation requires certified true copies of transcripts, diplomas, certificates of marriage for name change, etcetera translated to English or French as necessary. The aforementioned agencies are the only three agencies that NDAEB will accept reports from; however, if an applicant has applied to NDAEB and been accepted to enter the dentistry exam process, the NDAEB will accept those reports in lieu of ICES, IQAS or WES reports. The foreign trained applicant going through the NDEB process is still required to submit certified true copies of academic records, certified by a lawyer/notary/commissioner of oaths certified in Canada.
> 
> The last eligibility pathway, besides education completed in Canada, is acceptance by the Association of Canadian Faculties of Dentistry (ACFD) the agency that examines foreign trained dentists for admission into Canadian universities for dentistry equivalency programs. Those candidates can upon successfully writing the ACFD exam, enter a dentistry program in Canada in the 3rd year and complete year 3 and 4 and are then eligible for graduation and the NDAEB exam. They must provide NDAEB with certified true copies of academic records and proof of admission into the ACFD process to be considered for eligibility by this Board.

### 评估 Assessment - 飞出国 ###

对于国际受训牙医助理而言，必须联系加拿大全国牙医助理考试委员会（NDAEB）。NDAEB是负责管理全国牙医助理考试的机构。萨斯客彻温省要求所有的牙医助理只有持有NDAEB认证资格证书，才能申请省级牙医助理注册。对于国际受训牙医助理和其他有资质的牙科专业人士（牙医和保健专家）而言， NDAEB资格认证分为2部分：NDAEB笔试和临床执业评估（CPE）。

要符合NDAEB笔试参考条件必须进行学历评估。NDAEB要求申请人在一些专业领域达到最低的受训标准。关于专业领域受训和学历认证流程的信息可参考[NDAEB](http://www.ndaeb.ca/)网站了解， 其标题为“国际申请人”。

进行学历认证前，需将要求的文件材料、表格和费用交到以下任一国际学历资质评估机构：

- 国际学历评估服务机构[（ICES）](http://www.bcit.ca/ices), 会有一份综合报告；
- 国际学历评估服务机构[（IQAS）](http://www.employment.alberta.ca/Immigration/4512.html), 会有一份课程评估描述；
- 世界教育服务机构-加拿大[（WES）](http://www.wes.org/ca),会有一份课程报告。

确保评估机构会将评估报告直接邮寄给NDAEB和申请人。

等待学历评估报告期间，可以将其他要求的资料和表格提交给NDAEB。提交资料时，需要将提交学历认证资料的日期告知NDAEB。 NDAEB在收到ICES/IQAS/WES学历认证报告之前会保管申请人的所有申请材料，收到学历评估报告后，会审核是否有资格参加全国笔试考试。

需要提交的申请材料如下：

- 真实的学业记录材料，由加拿大律师，公证员或专员宣誓公证，并提交到NDAEB。学历评估报告将由评估机构（ICES、IQAS或WES）直接交给NDAEB。
- 如果学业成绩单和其他材料不是英文的，需要翻译成英文后进行公证。
- ICES、IQAS或WES学历评估报告，或NDEB/ACFD注册证明，以及个人信息同意表。
- 如果学业记录里面的姓名不同于申请人当前姓名，需提交姓名变更证明公证文件（由加拿大律师、公证员或专员进行宣誓公证）。
- 填写好的牙医助理课程报告（可从NDAEB网站直接下载）。
- 已签字的同意表，声明同意NDAEB收集和了解关于申请人的所有信息（可以从NDAEB网站直接下载）
- [NDAEB网站链接](http://www.ndaeb.ca/) .ICES、IQAS和WES的网站链接、省级DARA联系方式、加拿大教育项目列表以及NDAEB申请所需的材料均可在NDAEB网站上查询。

提交申请材料后，多久才能审核并得出结论（有时需要交付要求的费用）？

- NDAEB收到申请材料和学历评估报告（ICES、IQAS或WES）后，NDAEB会在4周内进行审核并做出决定。
- 取得NDAEB考试资格，参加笔试和临床执业评估（CPE），通过后取得NDAEB颁发的资格证书， 整个流程周期约为4到5个月。具体时间依据具体情况变化， 即何时获得参考资格、申请人能否成功通过笔试和临床执业评估。如果没有通过笔试和临床评估考试，需要再次参加，申请周期就会延长，因为笔试和临床执业评估每3个月进行一次。

会自动通知申请人关于已收到申请材料、材料遗失或缺失情况吗？

- 会书面通知申请人申请状态；
- 为防止申请材料遗失，尚不完整的材料在收到所有要求的材料之前以文件形式保管（申请人要求退还之前提交的材料并退出考试资格审核的情况除外）
- 如果申请人提交了部分申请材料且整个NDAEB审核过程并未完成，这种情况下如果全国入门水平标准发生变化，申请人需要重新提交符合新的全国入门标准的申请材料。

有哪些费用？

- 目前NDAEB资格认证不收取任何费用。

初步评估工具有效吗？

- 申请人可以通过完成牙医助理课程报告进行自我评估，评估自己的专业资质。该牙医助理课程报告可在该网站获得http://www.ndaeb.ca/。
- 所有国家的申请人都有资格进行学历评估，但并不是所有国家的教育系统都满足加拿大入门标准，尤其是牙医助理。
- 申请人最多只能参加3次考试。如果3次考试都没有通过，只能等完成重新训练后才能继续参加考试。

有没有一些国家的申请人可以不进行初级评估？

- 美国申请人不需要提交ICES、IQAS或WES评估报告。NDAEB会直接联系美国教育项目负责人了解相关教育情况；
- 加拿大牙科助理监管机构与其他国家之间不存在牙科助理职业的互认协议。

完成评估后，申请人会收到什么？ 如何通知申请人？

- 收到申请人的考试申请后，NDAEB会给申请人发出考试资格确认信。申请人成功通过NDAEB笔试和临床执业评估（或者是完成CDAD认可的且等同于临床执业评估的加拿大教育项目）后，会授予申请人NDAEB资格证书。

NDAEB收到申请人提交的所有要求材料以及WES/IQAS/ICES评估报告后，会审核申请人材料，决定其能否参加全国考试。如果NDAEB认为申请人的牙医助理专业的教育等同于加拿大教育，则满足考试条件，具备考试资格。

The NDAEB certificate will be issued after the applicant successfully completes the NDAEB written exam and CPE or completes education at a CDAC accredited program in Canada in lieu of CPE.
> 
> After NDAEB has received all of the required information, including the assessment report from WES, IQAS, or ICES, it will make a decision about your eligibility to write the national exam. If NDAEB determines that your education in dental assisting is substantially equivalent to Canadian education, they will grant you exam eligibility.

### 部分认可-技能进修途径 Partial Recognition <span class="s8">– Pathway to Skills Upgrading</span> - 飞出国 ###

如果NDAEB认为申请人教育背景在所有技能方面都不能够等同于加拿大学历标准，将拒绝其考试申请。 同时会指导申请人参加有效的教育项目来进一步提升教育水平。

如何才能使NDAEB完全认可申请人的学历？

- 如果牙医助理教育不满足考试申请规定的学历要求，可以通过参加加拿大牙医助理教育项目完成Gap training。

### 认可-认证途径 Recognition <span class="s8">– Pathway to Certification</span> - 飞出国 ###

如果NDAEB认为你的学历等同于加拿大学历标准，就可以申请参加NDAEB笔试。该考试每年举办4次，在加拿大全国很多城市都有。笔试包含200道多项选择题，主要考察牙科助理职业所需的基础知识、技能和态度。可在NDAEB网站上查看申请表、考试手册和考试费用相关信息。

考试结束后4至6周会收到考试成绩。如果第一次考试未通过，可再次参加；第二次未通过，需向NDAEB提交一份学习计划，其中要注明将如何提高考试成绩。只有NDAEB认可了你的学习计划，才能再次参加考试。

该考试最多能够参加3次。如果3次均未通过该考试，则必须参加一个正式的加拿大口腔牙医助理教育项目，且该项目必须得到加拿大牙科认证委员会认可，才能再次参加NDAEB笔试。

笔试通过后，还需通过临床执业评估，才能被授予NDAEB资格证书。CPE要求你能够在人体模型上证明自己具备9种不同的临床技能。该项测试时间为5到6个小时，每年举办4次。可在NDAEB网站上查看申请表、考试手册和考试费用相关信息。

完成CPE评估后4至6周会收到评估结果。如果其中某些技能未通过评估，还有2次机会可以评估这些未通过的技能。如果最终仍未通过，需要参加一个认可的加拿大牙医助理教育项目来提升技能水平。从初次参加CPE评估开始算起，13个月内必须通过所有9项技能评估。如果未完全通过，则必须重新评估所有9项技能（之前通过的和未通过的均包含在内），或者必须参加认可的牙医助理教育项目来提升技能水平。

如果只有部分技能通过了CPE评估，可以申请注册萨斯克彻温省牙医助理协会限制性执业资格证。如果申请通过，则可以利用已通过CPE评估的那些技能执业。限制性资格证有一个期限。必须在该期限之前完成剩下的未通过技能评估。请看步骤4了解更多关于SDAA资格证申请的信息。

国际受训牙医助理可以选择参加加拿大认可的牙医助理教育项目中的进修课程，这样就不必进行CPE评估。所参加的进修课程必须包含CPE要求的9项理论和临床培训。关于被认可的牙医助理教育项目的更多信息，参见NDAEB网站上学校列表。如果有疑问，可直接联系NDAEB了解。

一旦完成NDAEB笔试和临床执业评估（CPE），就会收到NDAEB资格证书。同时你打算注册的省级监管机构也会收到你的笔试和临床执业评估考试结果。当你申请注册的时候，需要提交NDAEB资格证复印件。

评估完成后，需要做什么？

- 获得NDAEB资格证后，就具备了在萨斯克彻温省注册的资格；
- 填写申请表，提供牙科教育证明材料原件和复印件，提交NDAEB资格证原件和复印件；
- 缴纳要求的费用；
- 申请材料完整提交后，会在1周内对你的申请进行处理。

> If NDAEB has assessed your education as being substantially equivalent to Canadian standards, you may apply to write the first exam – the NDAEB Written Exam. The exam is offered four times per year in a number of cities across Canada. The Written Exam contains 200 multiple choice questions which test the basic knowledge, skills, and attitudes you need to practice as a dental assistant. You can find the application form, exam handbook and information on exam fees on the NDAEB website.

> You will receive your exam results in the mail 4-6 weeks after you write the exam. You may write the exam again if you do not pass it on your first attempt. If you fail on the second attempt, you must submit a study plan to NDAEB that explains how you intend to improve your results. NDAEB must approve this plan before you are allowed to register to re-write the exam again.

> You may write the exam a maximum of <u>three</utimes. If you fail on the third attempt, you must attend a full intra-oral dental assisting education program in Canada at a program accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation of Canada (CDAC) to become eligible to write the NDAEB exam again.

> After you pass the Written Exam, you will need to pass the Clinical Practice Evaluation (CPE) before you can receive your NDAEB Certificate. The CPE asks you to demonstrate 9 different clinical skills on a mannequin. This test takes about 5-6 hours and it is offered 4 times per year in a number of cities. You can find the application form, information on fees and the CPE Handbook on the NDAEB website.

> You will receive your CPE results by mail 4-6 weeks after you complete the evaluation. If you were not successful in all of the skill areas, you can be re-evaluated in the unsuccessful skill areas two more times. If you are still not successful, you will be referred to an accredited Canadian dental assisting program for upgrading. You must be successful in all the skill areas within 13 months of the date you first attempted the CPE. If this is not possible, you must apply to re-do the entire CPE (including the skill areas you were successful in), or you must enroll in an accredited dental assisting program for upgrading.

> If you have been successful in some CPE skill areas and not successful in others, you can apply to Saskatchewan Dental Assistants’ Association (SDAA) for a Restricted Practice licence. If your application is approved, you will be able to practice the skills in which you were successful. The restricted license will have an expiration date. You must successfully complete your remaining clinical requirements by that date. Please see Step 4 to learn more about applying to SDAA for a license.
 
> As an internationally-trained dental assistant, you have the choice to attend an upgrading course in an **accredited** Canadian dental assisting program, rather than completing the CPE. The upgrading course you attend must provide theoretical and clinical training in the 9 clinical skills tested by the CPE. For more information on accredited dental assisting programs, see the list of schools on the NDAEB website. If you have questions, contact NDAEB directly.

> Once you have completed the NDAEB Written Exam and the CPE, you will receive your NDAEB Certificate. The regulatory body for the province in which you want to register will have already been informed about your exam and CPE results, but you will need to submit a copy of your Certificate when you apply for registration.

> What are the next steps following assessment completion?

> - Following attainment of your NDAEB Certificate you are eligible to apply for registration and licensure in Saskatchewan.
> - Complete the application form and provide copies of your original dental education and your NDAEB certificate.
> - Submit payment according to application form.
> - Pending completeness of application, your registration and licence will normally be processed within one week.
