## 关于安大略省化学专业协会 About ACPO - 飞出国 ##

化学家开发，测试，规范安大略省普通公民日常生活的方方面面，甚至惠及全世界，这就是为什么一个可靠的专家在化学行业如此重要。

安大略省化学专业协会有严格的认证流程来审核其会员资格，并且制定了职业道德守则，设立了纪律委员会。

ACPO提供了一条交流途径，通过这种方式，化学家可以与行业内其他人士进行交流，也可以参与职业发展规划。但更重要的是，化学家们可以共同协作，造福社会。

我们的主要工作之一是代表安大略省化学家促进执照的推行，进而提高我们在公众眼中，同类机构及安大略省中的执行标准。

> As chemists, we develop, test, and regulate many facets in the everyday lives of ordinary citizens across Ontario, if not the world. This is why it is paramount for the public to have credible experts in the chemical profession.
> 
> The Association of the Chemical Profession of Ontario already has in place a rigid accreditation process to examine qualifications of its members, and also has a Code of ethics and a disciplinary committee.
> 
> The ACPO provides a practical avenue for chemists to interact with peers and participate in career development initiatives. But most importantly, the Association provides a way for chemists to collectively work towards the betterment of society.
> 
> One of our main endeavours is the push for licensure on behalf of Ontario chemists to improve our standards of excellence in the eyes of the public, our peers, and our province.

### 非正式会员转为正式会员 Upgrade from Associate - 飞出国 ###

如何从非正式会员升级为正式会员？

成为正式会员后，执业过程中可以使用“特许化学家”头衔。特许化学家需遵守严格的道德和公益行为准则。同行业化学家、雇主、广大市民和安大略省政府视他们为专业人士。越来越多的雇主愿意雇佣特许化学家，这通常是招聘的要求之一。

此外，将授予正式会员特许化学家印章和证书。1984年ACPO法案对特许化学家头衔的使用做出了严格规定，只有享有良好声誉的ACPO注册会员才可以使用。

ACPO章程规定的正式会员注册要求：

1. 在认可的大学项目中取得化学、化学工程或化学科学方向荣誉学士学位，或同等学历；还要有2年ACPO认可的工作经验；研究生培训等同于工作经验。
2. 其他学历资质，如化学专业3年制本科学历，至少5年的工作经验，和化学领域专业能力的记录单，如发表的文章、出版物或专利。
3. 有至少6年化学领域被认可工作经验，但是不满足以上学历要求的个人也可以达到会员申请条件。但是必须要通过毕业生入学考试化学部分的测试。

如果申请人在化学科学方面有杰出的特殊贡献，且得到了同行的认可。考试委员会可能会将其推荐给协会，成为会员。

对特殊贡献申请人而言，需要参加一个面试，由一个委员会主席、至少3个委员会议员和其他合适的化学家对申请人进行面试。面试开始前2周前会通知申请人面试地点。

如果满足上述要求且想要升级为正式会员，请向ACPO提交支持性材料，ACPO会转交给注册官进行审核。

> Have you thought of upgrading your membership status to that of a Full Member?
> 
> By becoming a Full Member you are entitled to use the title of Chartered Chemist or C. Chem. when representing yourself in professional matters. Chartered Chemists follow a strict Code of Conduct regarding ethical practices and the public welfare. They are regarded as professionals by fellow chemists, employers, the general public, and the Ontario Government. There is also an increasing trend for employers to hire Chartered Chemists, and they often make it a requirement for employment.
> 
> In addition, a Full Member is issued a C. Chem. stamp and certificate. The ACPO Act of 1984 restricts the use of the designation "Chartered Chemist" or "C. Chem." to registered ACPO members in good standing.
> 
> The ACPO by-laws for full membership require:
> 
> 1. An Honours undergraduate degree, or its equivalent from an accredited university program in Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, or the Chemical Sciences, plus two years of work experience acceptable to the Association. Post-graduate training will be credited as equivalent to work experience.
> 1. Other academic qualifications, e.g. a three-year undergraduate degree with a major in Chemistry, extensive work experience (minimum 5 years), and a record of professional competence in the chemical field as evidenced by publications or patents.
> 1. Individuals who have at least six years of acceptable experience in the chemical field, but who do not possess the above academic qualifications, may qualify for membership by passing the Graduate Record Examination®, Chemistry Section.
> 
> In specials cases, the Board of Examiners may present individuals to the Council for consideration based on their exceptional contributions to the science of chemistry as recognized by their peers.
> 
> In the latter case, the applicant may be invited to an oral interview. This will be conducted by a committee convened by the Chair, and shall consist of at least three councillors plus other appropriate chemists as required by the Chair. The applicant shall be supplied with the areas that may be covered in the interview at least two weeks before the interview.
> 
> If you meet the above requirements and wish to upgrade your status, please submit the supporting documentation to the ACPO in care of the Registrar for review.
