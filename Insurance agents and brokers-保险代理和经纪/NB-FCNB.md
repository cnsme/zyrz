This Certificate must be an original and no older than 60 days.

The Insurance Act states that the applicant shall furnish a statement as to his trustworthiness and competency signed by at least three reputable persons resident of New Brunswick. We appreciate that there are some applicants that would have some difficulty to provide this statement because of not knowing any residents.  In light of this, we are willing to waive this requirement if the applicant has the sponsorship of an insurer who is licensed to conduct the business of other-than-life insurance in New Brunswick on their licence.
