## About RIBO ##

安大略省注册保险经纪人(RIBO)是安大略省保险经纪人的自律监管机构。RIBO始建于1981年10月，负责监管许可证，职业技能，道德行为以及和该省份和保险相关的所有的独立的普通保险经纪人的经济责任。


> The Registered Insurance Brokers of Ontario (RIBO) is the self-regulatory body for insurance brokers in Ontario. Established in October 1981, RIBO regulates the licensing, professional competence, ethical conduct, and insurance related financial obligations of all independent general insurance brokers in the province.

## 许可证 Licensing ##

直接处理公众的关于财产和意外事故险交易的个人和公司都必须要获得许可证。每个公司也必须有至少一名员工，且该员工是“非限制性”注册类的委托经纪人。

> Any individual and/or firm who deals directly with the public on any property and casualty insurance transaction must be licensed.  Each firm must also have at least one individual who holds the "Unrestricted" class of registration to act as the Principal Broker.
> 
> http://www.ribo.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=20&Itemid=23

### 个人许可证 Individual Licensing ###

所有的人必须要满足Section 5 of Ontario Regulation 991 of the RIB Act规定的“任职资格”。包括单并不仅限于以下内容：

- 通过[入门考试（Entry Level examination）](http://www.ribo.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=6:Exam%20Information&catid=1:Becoming%20a%20Broker&Itemid=49) 或 [同等水平的考试（Equivalency）](http://www.ribo.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=496&Itemid=138);
- 满足"only business or employment"的要求
- 在RIBO注册的普通保险经纪公司工作。工作（保证人）就不必参加考试了，但是必须要注册。

通过考试并符合"资格"的个人会收到一份附在通过信之后的就业证明信的表格。必须要完成这份表格，由委托经纪人签字后，并和规定的注册费用一起寄回给RIBO。

每年的注册费用（当前是$170.00，如有变更不另行通知）是从10月1日到次年的9月30日。在七月，八月和九月份进行的新的注册需要支付当前年费的50%，并另付整年的更新费用（因此当前的总的费用为$255.00）。注册证书将会于第二年的9月30日失效。否则不足一年的的话也不会扣除费用。整年或不足一整年的费用都是不会退还的。

必须要在完成考试之日起的12个月内，完成注册。如果没有在12个月内没有完成注册，则申请人必须要重新参加考试。很遗憾，超过12个月后没有延期。

非活跃公司的注册费用和个人注册的费用一样。

一旦完成注册，所有的保险经纪人必须要遵守RIBO的继续教育规定。

通过考试，但是还未注册且未收到注册证书的个人不能从事经纪人的工作。没有注册证书但是仍从事经纪人工作的会导致由Qualification and Registration Committee对你们的档案进行审查，可能会危机你们的许可证资格。


> All individuals must meet the "qualifications" outlined in Section 5 of Ontario Regulation 991 of the RIB Act. This includes, but is not limited to:
> 
> - Passing the [Entry Level examination](http://www.ribo.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=6:Exam%20Information&catid=1:Becoming%20a%20Broker&Itemid=49) or its [Equivalency](http://www.ribo.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=496&Itemid=138);
> - Satisfying the "only business or employment" requirement;
> - Employment with a RIBO registered general insurance brokerage firm. Employment (sponsorship) is not required to write the examination but is a requirement for registration.
> 
> Individuals who pass the examination and are otherwise "qualified" will be sent an Employment Letter Form attached to their passing letter. This form must be completed and signed by the Principal Broker of the brokerage and returned to RIBO with the required registration fee.The annual registration fee (currently $170.00 and subject to change without notice) covers the period from October 1st to September 30th. New registrations processed during the months of July, August and September are required to pay 50% of the current annual registration fee plus the full annual renewal fee (thus total fees required is currently $255.00).The certificate of registration will expire September 30th of the following year. Otherwise no reduction is allowed for part of a year. Fees are not refundable in whole or in part.
> 
> Registration must be completed within twelve (12) months from the date of successful completion of the examination. If registration does not occur within twelve (12) months, the applicant will be required to write the examination again. We regret there are no extensions.
> 
> The registration fee for the non-active firm is the same as it is for an individual registration.
> 
> Once registered, all licensed insurance brokers must comply with RIBO continuing education requirements.
> 
> Individuals who have passed the examination but who have not registered and not received their certificate of registration CANNOT hold themself out as or act in the capacity of a broker. Acting as a broker without a certificate of registration will result in your file being reviewed by the Qualification and Registration Committee and may jeopardize your eligibility for licencing.

## 考试 Examinations ##

建议计划参加考试的人认真查看他们的考试“标准”。

> It is recommended that individuals planning to write an examination carefully review the "Standards" for their examination.

### 入门水平 Entry Level (按规定从事该行业 Acting Under Supervision) ###

一完成入门水平或同等水平的考试四，考生就具备了"Acting Under Supervision"的限制。受"Acting Under Supervision"限制的经纪人不能控制信托基金，担任“委托经纪人”或成为独资经营者。

新的注册人员受"General Insurance Other Than Accident & Sickness" (RIBO By-law No. 1, Part XV, Section 15.4)的限制。意外险和疾病险是安大略省金融服务委员会（Financial Services Commission of Ontario）的人身险代理许可证中最常见的部分。安大略省金融服务委员会有具体的意外和疾病险的考试。通过提交当前的人身险许可证，包括意外险和疾病险的许可证，或提交通过意外和疾病险考试的证明，意外和疾病的限制就可以从RIBO注册里面删除。

另外，通过了当前的入门级考试的新的注册人在Travel Health 考试中至少获得满分的60%，就可以销售旅游健康保险（Travel Health Insurance）。没有通过考试的人可以参加单独的旅游健康考试。

通过了第二等级的考试the "Unrestricted - Technical"和"Unrestricted - Management"之后，对"Acting Under Supervision"的限制也会取消。



> Upon completion of the Entry Level or Equivalency examination, an individual is eligible with the restriction of "Acting Under Supervision".  A broker who is restricted to "Acting Under Supervision" cannot control trust funds, act as a "Principal Broker", or operate as a sole proprietor.
> 
> New registrants are restricted to "General Insurance Other Than Accident & Sickness" (RIBO By-law No. 1, Part XV, Section 15.4). Accident & Sickness insurance is most commonly included as part of a Life Insurance Agent's License from the Financial Services Commission of Ontario. The Commission has a specific Accident & Sickness examination.  The Accident & Sickness restriction can be removed from a RIBO registration by submitting a copy of a current life license including Accident & Sickness or evidence of passing the Accident & Sickness examination.
> 
> 
> Also, new registrants who pass the current Entry level examination with a minimum of 60% in the Travel Health section of the examination may sell Travel Health Insurance.  Individuals who are not successful may write a separate Travel Health examination.
> 
> The restriction of "Acting Under Supervision" can be removed by passing the second level of examinations, the "Unrestricted - Technical" and the "Unrestricted - Management".

### Unrestricted - Management ###

如果成功通过"Unrestricted - Management"考试和"Unrestricted - Technical Only"考试，考生就具备了 进行"Unrestricted"注册和担任代理业务的主要代理人的资格。不过，具备进行"Unrestricted"注册资格的人仍然有遵守所工作的公司的主要代理人的规定。

要申请参加"Unrestricted - Management"考试，考生必须要根据 "Acting Under Supervision"或"Unrestricted - Technical Only"的规定，符合RIBO注册的资格，并且在RIBO注册的公司至少有两年的工作经验。

即使成功通过"Unrestricted - Management"考试，仍然要遵守 "Acting Under Supervision"。建议所有要参加考试的考生应该认证阅读Standards for Management Skills。


> Successful completion of both the "Unrestricted - Management" examination and the "Unrestricted - Technical Only" examination qualifies an individual to the "Unrestricted" registration and therefore eligible to act as the Principal Broker of a broker business. However, individuals who hold an "Unrestricted" registration will still be under the direction of the Principal Broker of the firm they are employed by.
> 
> To make application to write the "Unrestricted - Management" examination, an individual must hold a RIBO registration restricted to "Acting Under Supervision" or "Unrestricted - Technical Only" and have been actively employed for at least two (2) years with a RIBO registered firm.
> 
> Successful completion of only the "Unrestricted - Management" examination will not remove the restriction of "Acting Under Supervision". It is suggested that all those planning to write the examination carefully review the Standards for Management Skills.

**关于考试 About the Examination**

"Unrestricted"注册的管理技能考试时长为3小时，试题包括3部分。至少试卷的每个部分完成60%，且整个试卷必须完成75%才能成功通过考试。如果第1部分或第3部分没有拿到最低分，而拿到了整份卷的75%，则可以只重考未通过的部分。否则的话考试的所有部分（3部分）都要重考。

试题是由经验丰富的保险专家团队共同出的，且每年进行修改两次，并根据保险行业的相关立法进行调整。

> The examination for Management Skills of the "Unrestricted" registration is three (3) hours in length and is comprised of three (3) parts. A minimum of 60% in each part and an overall total of 75% must be obtained to qualify successfully. Failure to obtain the minimum mark in either Part 1 or Part 3, provided the passing mark of 75% was obtained, a rewrite of that part alone would be granted. Otherwise, ALL three (3) parts of the examination must be rewritten.
> 
> The examination was developed by a team of experienced insurance professionals. It is revised bi-annually and with any legislative changes to the insurance industry.
