临床能力入门测试时间为1天半，应试者必须顺利通过该测试的所有版块。

### 时间安排

不列颠哥伦比亚牙科保健临床考试每年7月份举行一次，只要考试报名时间截止前报名人数不少于3个，就会在春季和秋季举行。

由于考试座位有限，申请者最好在报名时间截止之前亲自联系该学院预定考试位置。

#### 下次考试

下次考试时间： **2015年11月28日&29日**

报名截止时间: **2015年10月16日**

### 报名要求

在考试4周前，必须递交所有报名要求的资料。

临床考试申请者必须提供:

- 牙科保健专业项目毕业证明
- [国家牙科保健认证委员会](http://www.ndhcb.ca/en/index.php) 考试合格证明

考试费用必须包含在申请表中，报名截止时间之后，该费用将不可退还。

### 临床案例

每一位应试者都必须提供一位可以参加考试全程的临床案例。如果无法提供一位合格临床案例，应试者将不能参加考试，所以每一位应试者都必须确保提供的临床案例符合案例标准。

鉴于考试之前应试者不被允许了解临床案例的口腔情况，所以应试者最好咨询至少一位注册牙科保健员，评估该临床案例是否符合案例标准。

另一件重要的事是一定要确保该临床案例的身体状况足以应付长时间的考试环节。

如果临床案例没有出现或者被认为不符合考试要求，应试者将不能继续考试，除非找到另一个合格的临床案例。**注意：**无论是CDHBC工作人员还是CDHBC审查官都无法提供寻找临床案例方面的帮助。所以，为了避免不合格或其他特殊情况的发生，应试者最好提前筛选至少2位临床。在时间允许的情况下，审查官将会评估所有涉及的临床案例，但是，迟到的临床案例将不能接受审查。

### 考试范围

CDHBC临床考试包括如下内容：对健康和牙科工作经历的评估；对口外腔、口内腔、牙周组织以及沉淀物的评估；实施（超声波，清创术）；放射摄影影像解释，包括影像技术评价和解读；感染控制管理；常见疾病的安全实践；职业精神；诊断和治疗方案的完善。

> Foreign-trained dental hygienists and recent graduates of unaccredited programs and/or educational facilities not approved by the College (approved programs are listed in [Schedule I](http://www.cdhbc.com/Practice-Resources/Regulation-and-Bylaws/Schedules/Schedule-I-Dental-Hygiene-Programs.aspx)) must successfully complete the CDHBC Clinical Examination before being eligible for registration, unless the applicant has passed a dental hygiene clinical exam in another Canadian jurisdiction or is/has been registered in good standing within Canada (contact the College for more information).
> 
> Candidates are examined for safe, entry-level clinical competence over the course of one and a half days; all sections of the examination must be passed to be successful.
> 
> ### Timeline
> 
> The B.C. Dental Hygiene Clinical Examination is offered once per year in July, and will be offered in the Spring and Fall as long as a minimum of three applications are received prior to the deadline.

> 
> ### Requirements to Apply
> 
> Requirements be submitted four weeks prior to the examination date.
> 
> Clinical examination applicants must provide:
> 
> - Proof of graduation from a dental hygiene program
> - Proof of successful completion of the [National Dental Hygiene Certification Board](http://www.ndhcb.ca/en/index.php) examination

> 
> For more details, including fees and an outline of the exam format, refer to the Clinical Examination Information Guide.
> 
> ### Providing a Client
> 
> Each candidate is responsible for providing a client who is able to attend for the entire exam session. Failure to provide a suitable client results in failure of the exam, so it is imperative for each candidate to ensure that the client meets the client criteria.
> 
> Because the candidate is not permitted to have prior knowledge of the client’s oral condition, CDHBC recommends consulting at least one registered dental hygienist to evaluate whether the client criteria is fulfilled, although this does not guarantee acceptability.
> 
> It is also important to determine whether the client has any physical issues which may cause discomfort during long periods of sitting and oral examinations.
> 
> If a client fails to appear or is deemed to be inappropriate for the examination, the candidate will be unable to proceed with the exam unless a suitable replacement is available. Please note that CDHBC employees and examiners are unable to assist in finding clients. For this reason, it is best to pre-screen at least two clients in case of disqualification or extenuating circumstances. As time allows, examiners will assess all of the available clients; however, no allowance will be made for late arrivals.
> 
> ### Areas of Study
> 
> The CDHBC Clinical Exam includes evaluation of health and dental history; extra-oral, intra-oral, periodontal, and deposit assessments; implementation (ultrasonic, debridement); radiographic interpretation, including technique critique and interpretation of images; infection control management; safe practice for common medical conditions; professionalism; and completion of the diagnosis and treatment plan.

### 4.  临床案例 - 飞出国 ###

应试者应该提供合格临床案例。一位成人临床案例和至少一位备用临床案例必须能够出现在考试开始阶段（大约3个小时），接受审查官对临床案例的审查。  

第二天临床考试（包括休息时间在内大约9个小时），请让备用临床案例一直等到被拒绝或被通知其他临床案例获得认可。

评估应试者的临床能力时必须采用具体的案例标准，案例合格标准如下所示：

- 在365天内曾接受不列颠哥伦比亚牙科医生的检查
- 年满18周岁
- 牙齿数量不少于16颗（所有牙齿数量的3/4)，且包含一颗臼齿
- 至少8颗牙齿中包含适量的龈下牙石，分别分布在上下颌
- 至少1/6牙齿有轻微龈上牙石
- pockets 5 mm or greater around at least two teeth, including a molar, with calculus present in the pockets
- 身体状况可以承受一整天的牙科卫生评估和治疗（即不会由于颞下颌关节紊乱病、背痛等这些身体限制感到过度不适）
- 解读合格范围内的血压

临床案例只有满足考试要求，才可以参与临床考试。为了满足考试要求，应试者必须持有一份当前医疗历史，让注册牙科保健员为临床案例做一次检查，确保其符合考试要求，并且持有一份由临床案例签字的声明，证明在365天内由不列颠哥伦比亚牙科医生为其做了牙科检查。

临床案例不能是牙科专业人士.

应试者不可以详细了解临床案例的口外腔情况，也不可以查看之前的图表或临床案例记录。如果临床案例只有有限的英语水平，应试者必须保证口译人员可以出现在考试现场。  

如果出现在考试现场的临床案例不满足声明的案例标准，不能够参与应试者临床技能评估，身体状况不适合参与口腔卫生护理，或者365天内没有让不列颠哥伦比亚牙科医生为其做牙科检查，他们将不能作为临床案例参与考试。应试者必须在规定的时间内找到其他符合条件的临床案例，才可以继续参加安排的考试。如果应试者无法提供合格的临床案例，将不符合考试条件。所以，如果应试者不确定临床案例是否满足考试要求，最好提前准备备选的临床案例。  

临床案例应该了解考试目的和考试性质，且必须明白在临床考点的一天里只能解决他们的牙科保健部分需要。考虑到临床案例会坐比较长的时间，所以，最好提前检查其背部问题或其他疼痛问题。临床案例还应该清楚考试会需要一整天，审查官会进行多种检查和检测。如果考试期间需要使用临床案例的射线照片，应试者最好自带这些东西，协助评估、牙科保健诊断、计划和实施。如果临床案例不提供射线照片，考试过程中会有一次机会可以要求他们提供射线照片。

无论是在考试前还是在考试中，CDHBC的工作人员或审查官都不能为应试者提供任何寻找临床案例方面的帮助。

临床案例最好来自:

-   朋友、家属、熟悉的人
-   报纸、广告
-   教育机构、老年中心等的张贴通告

### 5. 可用器械 ###

考试设施将是一家设备齐全的现代化牙科诊所。如果你需要专门适用于左撇子的设备，请联系学院办公室。  

应试者应该提供:

- 所有手用器械
- 手套、口罩和口腔卫生设备
- 围嘴链
- 手镜
- 钢笔
- 视觉教具
- 油石和检验棒
- 以及其他考试需要的药品、设备和器械

例如，考试地点将不提供一次性螺旋式弯角，应试者如果有必要使用必须自己提供。应试者最好准备两套考试设备，为备用临床案例使用或者避免考试设备被意外污染。应试者可能携带自己的超声波装置和工作尖参加考试。

**注意:** 该考试可能会在无乳胶的环境下进行。有关考试设施是否可以使用乳胶用品，请联系学院办公室。

所有待到考试现场的设备都必须进行消毒，因为考试之前将没有时间对这些设备进行消毒。考试之后，诊所工作人员将会为应试者清洗、干燥并包裹这些设备，但是，在诊所关闭之前将没有时间对这些设备进行再次消毒。

应试者可以使用的药品和设备包括:

- 临床案例检查图表和记录
- 血压表套袖/听诊器
- 可以读出摄氏度数值的任意型号的温度计  
- 全套射线探伤仪以及处理设施

该设施为审查官提供双头探索和颜色编码的牙周探测。应试者也可以使用这些设备。考试结束所有设备都必须归还给诊所工作人员。

### 6.  临床程序 ###

应试者将会收到详细的考试信息，包括考试安排、地点以及能力标准，为考试做准备。

审查官将使用国际牙齿编号系统。

临床考试包含不同的版块，应试者必须在规定的时间段内完成所有版块。考试时间将受到严格控制。一些程序会在完成时获得评估，而其他程序将在进行中以及完成时获得评估。审查员独立评估每个版块时，应试者会被要求离开临床区域。应试者将接受专业安全临床能力入门水平方面的审查。

<span class="p">审查官评估每个程序时将会对比应试者的实践和具体书面标准，这些标准列在《能力标准》文件中。不能携带《临床能力标准》进入临床考试。

一旦审查官认为临床案例或其他考试参与者有危险，审查官将有权拒绝该临床案例和应试者参加临床考试。

> ### 4.  CLIENTS ###
> 
> Candidates are responsible for providing a suitable client. One adult client and at least one back-up client must be able to attend at the beginning of the exam session (approximately 3 hours) to be evaluated by the examiners for consideration as a client
> 
> for the second day of in-clinic testing _(approximately 9 hours with breaks; see the provided schedule)_. **Please request that your back-up client(s) wait until dismissed
> or until notified that an alternate client has been approved.**
> 
> Specific client criteria are required in order to assess the candidate's clinical competence. <span class="p">Criteria for client suitability are:</span>
> 
> - has been examined by a B.C. dentist within the previous 365 days
> - minimum age of 18
> - minimum total of 16 teeth, with teeth in at least three quadrants; including one molar
> - moderate amounts of subgingival calculus in at least eight teeth, distributed in both the maxillary and mandibular arches
> - light supragingival calculus in at least one sextant
> - pockets 5 mm or greater around at least two teeth, including a molar, with calculus present in the pockets
> - physically able to undergo a full day of dental hygiene assessment and treatment (ie. will not suffer excessive discomfort due to physical limitations such as TMD, back pain, etc.)
> - blood pressure reading within an acceptable range
> 
> To participate in the exam, a client must meet the criteria. <span class="p">To ensure suitability the candidate should obtain a current medical history, have a registered dental hygienist do a screening check to verify that the client meets the examination criteria, and obtain a signed statement by the client verifying that a dental examination has been performed by a B.C. dentist within the previous 365 days (the Client Release Form).</span>
> 
> Clients cannot be members of the dental profession.
> 
> Candidates should not have full detailed knowledge of the client’s intra -oral <span class="s1"></spancondition and should not have reviewed previous charting or client records. <span class="s1"></span<span class="p">If the client’s English is limited, the candidate should ensure that an interpreter is available during the examination.</span>
> 
> <span class="p">If clients brought to the examination do not meet the stated criteria and are not suitable to assess the candidate's clinical skills, or are not medically suitable for dental hygiene care, or have not had a dental examination by a B.C. dentist within the previous 365 days, they will be disqualified as exam clients. An acceptable alternative client needs to be available in enough time for the candidate to continue with the examination as scheduled.</spanInability to provide a suitable client will result in disqualification from <span class="s1"></spanthe examination<span class="s4">.</span<span class="p">An alternative/back-up client is strongly suggested if a candidate is unsure of the client's acceptability or reliability.</span>
> 
> Clients should be made aware of the intent and nature of the examination, and the fact that only some of their dental hygiene needs will be met during their one day in clinic. _**Pre-screening for back problems or other pain issues is recommended due to the length of time the client will be seated.** _The client should know that a whole day will be required for this exam and that there will be multiple examinations and probings by the examiners. If client radiographs are available, candidates are advised to bring them to the examination to assist with assessment, dental hygiene diagnosis, planning and implementation. If radiographs are not provided by the client, there will be an opportunity to request them during the examination.
> 
> The CDHBC, its staff or examiners cannot assist candidates in obtaining clients <span class="s1"></spanbefore or during the examination.
> 
> The best sources for clients include:
> 
> -   friends, relatives, acquaintances
