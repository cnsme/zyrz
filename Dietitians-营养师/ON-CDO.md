## 私人公司 PROFESSIONAL CORPORATIONS ##

对营养师专业专业公司有限制性条件。这些规定的目的就是为了使营养师避免向客户承担职业责任，并减少安大略省营养师学院的职业责任。商业公司法，监管卫生行业法和学院的章程4都贵这些限制性条件作出了规定，包括：

1. 卫生行业公司在经营职业活动之前，必须获得安大略省营养师学院颁发的授权证书。该文件的主要目的就是确保学院了解专业公司的股东，股东能负责公司的专业活动。第二个目的就是要确保专业公司已经满足了所有的要求和限制条件（省政府已经把该责任授权给了营养师学院）。
2. 专业公司的所有的股东必须是同所学院的成员。例如，营养师和理疗师不能使同个专业公司的股东。该项条件有效的排除了大部分的营养师的家人因收入出现分歧的可能性。
3. 董事和主管。董事和主管持有专业公司的全部股份。这就意味着他们是同所学院的成员。
4.  专业公司的命名必须包括至少一位股东的名字，必须叫"专业公司"，且必须包括职业代码（例如）e.g., dietetics，且不能包括其他的成分。禁止使用公司编号（例如1234567 安大略省公司）。减少灵活性能确保病人和监管机构知道他们正在和谁打交道。
5.  专业的公司不能逃避对客户的责任，或者任何大众的责任。一项具体的的规定要求对客户或大众的责任高于对公司忠诚的任何责任。此外，股东要承担对公司客户的任何职业的疏忽责任。
6.  同样，专业公司不能逃避对安大略省营养师学院的责任。再次，明确规定要求营养师优先承担对学院的责任。
7.  公司只能在职业范围内从事相关工作，或提供“辅助”服务。例如，向顾客卖相关产品（服务于任何利益冲突）和盈余收入投资就是辅助性服务。买房地产或人寿保险就不是辅助性的服务。

> There are restrictions on professional corporations for dietitians. The purpose of these rules is to prevent dietitians from avoiding their professional responsibilities to their clients and from circumventing their professional obligations to the College of Dietitians of Ontario. These restrictions, found in the Business Corporations Act, the Regulated Health Professions Act, and College By-Law 4 , include: 
>  
> 1. A Certificate of Authorization must be obtained from the College of Dietitians of Ontario before a health professional corporation can practise a profession. The primary purpose of this document is to ensure that the shareholders of the professional corporation are known to the College and are accountable for the professional actions of the corporation. A second purpose is to ensure that the requirements and restrictions on the professional corporation have been met (the provincial government has downloaded this responsibility to the Colleges).
> 1. All shareholders of the professional corporation must be members of the same College. For example, a dietitian and a physiotherapist could not be shareholders of the same professional corporation. This restriction effectively eliminates the possibility of income splitting with family members for most dietitians.
> 1. Officers and Directors. Officers and directors must all be shareholders of the professional corporation. That means that they will all be members of the same College.
> 1. The name of the professional corporation must contain the name of at least one shareholder, must say "professional corporation", must include a reference to the profession (e.g., dietetics) and must contain nothing else. Numbered corporations (e.g., 1234567 Ontario Ltd.) are not permitted. This lack of flexibility ensures that patients and regulators know with whom they are dealing.
> 1. The professional corporation cannot be used to avoid a duty to a client or even to a member of the public who is not a patient. A specific provision requires that this duty to patients or the public override any competing duty of loyalty to the corporation. In addition, shareholders can be sued for any professional negligence or liability they may have to the patients of the corporation.
> 1. Similarly, the professional corporation cannot be used to avoid a duty to the College of Dietitians of Ontario. Again, a specific provision requires that a dietitian's duty to the College take precedence.
> 1. The corporation can only practise within the scope of the profession or provide "ancillary" services. For example, selling related products to clients (subject to any conflict of interest concerns) is probably ancillary. Investing surplus income is generally ancillary. Selling real estate or life insurance is probably not ancillary.
