## About the NDHCB ##

The National Dental Hygiene Certification Board - or "NDHCB" for short -  was formed in 1994 to address an important need of dental hygienists working in Canada.
 
The Canadian Dental Hygienists' Association (CDHA), acting on research conducted with hygenists across Canada, began to investigate a certification process to enhance portability (the ability of dental hygienists to become licensed or registered in all Canadian jurisdictions) through a nationally recognized credential.
 
The NDHCB was then given the mandate to develop and administer the National Dental Hygiene Certification Examination (NDHCE).

## 关于NDHCB ##

国家口腔认证委员会-简称NDHBC-于1994年成立，委员会的成立是为了解决加拿大对牙医的需求。

加拿大牙科保健协会（CDHA）和卫生专家一起在全加拿大开展研究，研究认证的过程，通过国家认证考试以增强其可移植性（在加拿大所有的司法管辖区，牙科卫生人员成为注册的牙科卫生员能力）

NDHBC被授权去研究和管理国家口腔卫生认证考试（NDHCE）

http://www.ndhcb.ca/#!educational-requirements/crhu
### Educational Requirements/Credential Standards ###
 
In order to be considered for an Assessment of Credentials and Qualifications, any applicant must be able to provide evidence of minimum requirements. In its assessment process, the NDHCB uses four (4) minimum criteria that must be met before it can proceed further:
 
- Criterion 1 - the applicant must have graduated with a diploma or its equivalent, in dental hygiene.
 
- Criterion 2 - the dental hygiene program must be established as a separate school, faculty, division or department recognized by the appropriate government agency in the country/jurisdiction where the program is established at a post-secondary institution which is also recognized by the appropriate government agency.
 
- Criterion 3 - the program must be of a minimum of two (2) full time academic years of formal dental hygiene education in a recognized Dental Hygiene program, including a clinical component with direct client care supervised by dental hygiene faculty.
 
- Criterion 4 - the program must have learning outcomes/competencies and evaluation criteria set out in a clear, concise and detailed manner to the satisfaction of the NDHCB.

**Note:**  Applicants must meet all of the Educational Requirements (criteria 1 to 4 above) before the NDHCB can even open an Eligibility evaluation file on their behalf. If those criteria are not met, the NDHCB will not conduct an evaluation of the applicant’s curriculum, will reimburse the application fee minus a non-refundable fee of $100 + tax, and the applicant will be denied eligibility.  Please make sure to consult the Educational Credentials and Qualifications Assessment for Eligibility to write the National Dental Hygiene Certification Board Examination Handbook (see "Equivalency Assessment Handbook" in the "Quick Links" menu) for further details about how to apply for eligibility.


#### 3.非认证的口腔卫生课程毕业生 ####

申请人毕业于非CADC或者美国牙科委员会认证的口腔卫生课程，包括加拿大或美国之外的牙科卫生专业毕业生符合以下标准的可以申请参加NDHCB考试：

为了能够有资格参加资质评估，申请人须尽可能多的提供满足要求的证明。 在评估过程中，必须满足NDHCB的4项标准：

- 标准一，申请人必须有口腔卫生专业的毕业证或有同等学力
- 标准二，口腔卫生专业必须是由国家或司法区域的相关政府部门认可的独立学校，机构或部门设立，并且课程也是有相关政府部门认可的高等院校设立的
- 标准三，项目须是经过认证的口腔卫生项目并且是不少于两年的正规的教育，包括有口腔卫生学院设立的临床服务
- 标准四，项目必须设置好清晰，简明和详细的学习成果和能力以上满足NDHCB的要求
 
**注：** 申请人必须满足以上要求（标准1-4）才有NDHCB的评估资格。 如果申请人不满足以上要求，NDHCB则不会对申请人的课程进行评估并退回申请费,减去不可退回的费用$100+税，申请人也会失去资格。可对教育证书和资格评估方面进行咨询以确认怎么申请NDHCB考试。


#### Assessment Policies and Decisions ####
 
The NDHCB determines eligibility to write the NDHCE, in accordance with established criteria. One copy of the assessment report result will be issued to the applicant or his/her agent. A successful assessment result establishes eligibility for the applicant to apply to write the NDHCE within a period of three (3) years from the date of approval.
 
When an applicant’s assessment of credentials is deemed eligible to write the NDHCE, a letter to the applicant will outline the process on how to apply for the examination (NDHCE). The letter will also include the date of the next scheduled examination for which the applicant is eligible to apply.
 
An applicant who did not have his/her credentials deemed equivalent to those of a graduate of a Canadian accredited dental hygiene program will NOT be eligible to write the NDHCE. The assessment report sent to the applicant will outline specific deficiencies and suggest other mechanisms that may be available to pursue eligibility to write the NDHCE in the future. Once an applicant has been notified, in writing, of the negative result of the assessment, the applicant’s assessment of credentials’ file is closed. If the applicant wishes to reactivate the file, a new application, appropriate fees, and additional documentation must be submitted.
 
Assessment of credentials reports may differ over time as the NDHCB’s assessment decisions are based on the most recent educational assessment standards for the profession.

#### 评估政策和决定 ####

NDHCB根据已经制定的标准来决定参加NDHCE考试的资格，评估报告的副本会给申请人及其代理。 评估通过的话，申请人可以在3年内申请参加NDHBC考试。

当申请人确定有资格可以参加NDHBC考试的时候，申请人会收到一封信，信中会具体解释申请NDHBC考试的流程，也会包括申请人有资格参加下次考试的时间。

如果申请人没有与加拿大牙科卫生项目同等的学历，没有资格申请NDHBC考试。评估报告会具体说明申请人的不足并为以后申请NDHBC考试提供建议。一旦申请人被通知评估没通过，评估申请人资质的文件将会关闭。如果申请人向重新激活这个文件，需要交新的申请，相关费用和其他文件。

随着时间的推移，证书评估报告会与NDHBC的评估决定不同，NDHBC的评估决定是基于最新的职业方面的教育评估标准。
 
#### Notice of Right to Formal Review ####
 
Any applicant who is denied eligibility and believes that he/she was treated unfairly can request a formal review.  Please refer to Appeal Procedures (see "Quick Links") for more details about how to appeal an NDHCB decision.
 
**Note:**  If the applicant is deemed eligible to write the NDHCE, a language deficiency in either English or French shall not be grounds for review of examination results or for any form of special accommodations.

#### 审查权利 ####

任何申请人的申请被拒绝的话，如果他认为结果不公平，可以要求核查。 请查看终审程序，了解更多关于向NDHCB申诉的细节。

**注：** 如果申请人有资格参加NDHCE考试的话，英语或法语水平不好不会成为核查考试结果或需要任何特殊照顾的理由。

### What is the NDHCE? ###
 
The National Dental Hygiene Certification Examination (NDHCE) is designed to assist the provincial and territorial dental hygiene regulatory authorities to determine whether or not an applicant for certification, registration, or licensure possesses adequate knowledge and/or skill related to entry-level dental hygiene practice standards.
 
The NDHCE is intended to fulfill the written examination requirement. However, acceptance of the NDHCB Certificate is completely at the discretion of the individual provincial or territorial dental hygiene regulatory authority.
The format of the NDHCE is as follows:
 
- The exam is delivered in electronic form in computerized testing centres across Canada and is comprised of 200 multiple choice questions;
- This four-hour exam consists of 2 two-hour sessions delivered back to back but with a compulsory 15 min break in between;
- the passing score is calculated using a proven psychometric method. It should however be noted that over the last few years, it has always been between 66% and 71% for any specific examination;
- the International tooth numbering system is used in the exam;
- the Metric system is used throughout the exam; and
- the examination is offered three times a year (in January, May and September) in at least one centre in each region in Canada (see list).
 
The NDHCE tests the candidates' ability to apply their knowledge as entry-to-practice professionals to solve oral health care problems and answer questions related to dental hygiene practice. The examination is based on dental hygiene competencies (e.g. Dental Hygiene Process (DHP): Assessment & Diagnosis, DHP: Planning, DHP: Implementation, DHP: Evaluation) outlined in the latest Examination Blueprint. The dental hygiene competencies were reviewed and validated by dental hygiene professionals representing all fields of practice and all regions of Canada. Regulatory authorities were consulted to ensure that the competencies reflect dental hygiene practice in all jurisdictions.

### NDHCE定义 ###

国家牙科卫生考试（NDHCE）目标是帮助省或领地内牙科卫生认证机构判断注册或认证的申请人是否拥有足够的与牙科卫生标准相关的专业知识或技能。

NDHBC目的在完成书面考试要求。然而，仅仅有个别省内或领地内牙科卫生机构认可NDHCE证书。
NDHBC考试格式如下：

- 此考试以电子形式在全加拿大的计算机测试中心进行。考试题型有200道多选题组成；
- 考试时间为4个小时，分为两个阶段，每个阶段2个小时，中间休息15分钟；
- 考试成绩的计算采用认证心理测量学方法，近些年来，考试通过率约为66%到71%;
- 考试使用国际牙编号系统；
- 考试使用公制计算；
- 在加拿大的每个区域，至少一个中心，此考试每年举行3次（1月，5月和9月）

NDHBC考试测试候选人应用实践专业知识来解决口腔健康护理问题的能力和回答牙科卫生相关问题的能力。 考试以牙科卫生能力为基础（例如牙科卫生步骤（DHP）：评测&诊断， DHP：规划，实施，评估）以最新的考试蓝图为框架。 牙科卫生能力被加拿大各个地区和牙科卫生领域的人检查和更新。监管机构可确定在所有司法管辖区内牙科卫生实践能力的体现。
