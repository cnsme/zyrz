## 专业技师 - 飞出国 ##

ASTT条例修订和阿尔伯塔省立法制定

ASTTBC理事会已批准ASTT法规变更，这些变更关于所要达到的标准和“P TeCH”头衔的合理使用。 变更会将ASTT加到新的阿尔伯塔省立法中，该立法是在2009年10月14日公布。ASTT法规已被修改阅读。

如果已经注册的会员有至少四年的技术工作经验，除去技师认证所需的经验，并且具备协会认可的技师的能力，可以向协会注册技术人员、技术专家（地质）、技术专家（建筑），注册之后可以使用这些头衔： PTech, PTech(Eng), PTech(Geo) or PTech(Bldg).

阿尔伯塔省的工程、地质和地球物理专业法已被修订并与阿尔伯塔省的科学、工程和技术专业协会（ASET) 结合起来。自从ASTTBC的姐妹协会成立以来，已经在社会法令下开始运作。这种一个法令两个协会的立法模式建立了PTech名称并且给予PTech在已建立的标准和规范下独立运作的权利。 PTech 是ASET的成员但是由ASET，专业工程师协会，APEGA联合监管。其他分类，如CET, ASCT和CTech继续依照法令下的ASET条例运行。

尽管与PTech有关的ASTT条例已经生效，但是PTech程序尚未初始化。因此在这个时候，会员不可以在这个区域申请注册。



> http://www.asttbc.org/registration/technologists/professionaltechnologist.php
> ## Professional Technologist (PTech) ##

> ASTT Regulations Amended and Alberta Legislation Enacted

> The ASTTBC Council has approved changes to the ASTT Regulation pertaining to the standards required to achieve, and appropriate the use of, the title ‘Professional Technologist’ (PTech). The changes will bring the ASTT Regulations into alignment with new Alberta legislation proclaimed October 14, 2009. The ASTT Regulation has been revised to read,

> 2.2(d) A certified member who has a minimum of four (4) years of progressive technical experience in addition to the experience required for certification as an Applied Science Technologist or Certified Technician and has acquired the competencies commensurate with a Professional Technologist as recognized by the Council, may apply to the Board to be registered as a Professional Technologist, Professional Technologist Engineering), Professional Technologist (Geoscience) or Professional Technologist (Building) and, upon registration, shall be entitled to use the designation PTech, PTech(Eng), PTech(Geo) or PTech(Bldg).

> The Alberta Engineering, Geological and Geophysical Professions Act has been amended to incorporate the Association of Science, Engineering and Technology Professionals of Alberta (ASET), ASTTBC’s sister association, which has been operating under the Society Act since first established. This one act – two association legislative model establishes the PTech designation and grants PTechs the right to independent practice within established standards and codes. The PTech is a member of ASET but is jointly regulated (50:50 Boards) by ASET and the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta (APEGA). Other classifications such as CET, ASCT and CTech continue under ASET Regulations pursuant to the Act.

> Although the ASTT Regulation pertaining to PTech is now in force, the PTech program has not been initialized. Therefore at this time, members are not able to apply for registration in this area.

> Where we are today...

> ASTTBC and APEGBC are continuing to work together to discuss key areas of Qualified Professional (QP) status for technologists as well as the general discussions pertaining to possible joint regulation of the PTech in British Columbia. We appreciate your patience and feel that we are making good progress on behalf of technologists and technicians in BC.

> Please stay tuned to ASTT e-NEWS for further updates, or feel free to e-mail us at ptech@asttbc.org for more info.

## 外籍技师（ITPs)临时会员 - 飞出国 ##

制定这项政策的目的是确保ITPs符合当前ASTTBC的认证标准，但是还涉及一些来加拿大面临就业挑战的新移民。ITPs必须满足当前所有的学术标准和经验要求,“临时会员”仅提供给那些不满足一年工作经验的人。申请人可以获得与自己水平相当的证书，这证明申请人满足当时的学历要求和经验要求。然而，他们的会员证可能是临时的并且根据是否有一年所需工作经验而定。临时会员的有效期是五年，从注册之日开始算。五年之中的任一时间，临时会员可以申请成为普通会员。五年之后，理事会审查员会重新评估他们的会员资格。如果申请人有可能成为普通会员的话，协会会重新对他进行评估。

临时会员身份可以通过他的名字后的“Provisional”区别出来。 AScT（Provisional）和临时会员身份可以通过ASTTBC内部数据库查询出来。

临时会员证代表了他们的身份，证上清楚地标记了“临时”并且与当前AScT的普通会员证和 CTech 会员区别开来。

## Provisional Membership for Internationally Trained Professionals (ITPs) ##


> This policy is designed to ensure that current ASTTBC standards of certification are maintained for ITPs, but also addresses some of the employment challenges ITPs face as new immigrants to Canada. The ITPs will have to meet all the current academic criteria and experience requirements, with ‘Provisional Membership’ being provided for those who only lack the one year work experience demonstrating Canadian standards and competencies. These applicants would be given full certification, to the appropriate level (AScT or CTech), provided that the individual meets the academic and total experiential requirements required at the time of their application. Their membership certification, however, would be ‘Provisional’ and contingent on completion of the one year required work experience demonstrating Canadian standards and competencies. These ‘Provisional’ members would have a maximum period of five years, from the date of their registration approval; to complete the one year work experience requirement. At anytime during the five year period, the ‘Provisional’ member can apply for reclassification to have their ‘Provisional’ status upgraded to regular membership. After the five years, their membership status would automatically be required to be reassessed by the Board of Examiners. Such a reassessment could result in the Board reclassifying the individual to Associate, if the expectation is that the individual is unlikely to be able to progress to having the ‘Provisional’ status removed.

> The ‘Provisional’ member status would be identified by the member having his/her designation (AScT or CTech) followed by the word ‘Provisional’ in brackets after their name, i.e. AScT (Provisional) and this status would also be tracked within the internal data base of ASTTBC.

> Their ‘Provisional’ membership certificate would be designed specifically for their status, clearly marked as ‘Provisional’ and be differentiated from the regular membership certificate for current AScT and CTech members.

### 临时ITPs没有图章 - 飞出国 ###

ITPs必须完成职业道德考试和加拿大的技术人力资源委员会——专业实践模块(PIP),或申请时所需要的其他专业实践考试，考试在认证或注册之前完成。PIP模块须提供给ASTTBC，评估其完整性和可接受性。申请人的外国工作经验必须由证明人证明，并且ASTTBC可以直接联系到证明人，或者由公证处开确认信。一年的加拿大工作经验也必须符合加拿大的标准并且必须有认证或证明人证明。委员会规定ITPs要求完成职业发展并通过语言能力测试。

AScT 注册需要技术报告，除非放弃由理事会审查员评估学历那部分。ITPs还需要技师水平的技术报告，除非先前被理事会拒绝，这些在五年临时身份内完成并且在临时身份被取消之前完成。技术报告的目的是反映他的加拿大工作经验。

ITPs 的过程不会降低我们目前的会员等级并且区别开符合ASTTBC证书申请基本标准的潜在雇员。这样在招聘过程中，雇主可以轻易的识别这些人的简历。

> ### Provisional ITPs will not be issued a stamp. ###

> The ITPs will have to complete the Professional Ethics Examination and Canadian Technology Human Resources Board – Professionalism in Practice Module (PIP), or any other professional practice examination that would be required at the time of their application, prior to being certified and registered. The PIP module would have to be provided to ASTTBC for evaluation of completeness and acceptability. Their international work experience would also have to be validated by references that could be directly contacted by ASTTBC or supported by notarized confirmation letters. The one year work experience would also to demonstrate Canadian standards and competencies, and have to be at the appropriate level of certification and supported by appropriate references. Council may also stipulate that ITPs be required to complete professional development in career orientation or pass a language competency test.

> A technical report is a current requirement for AScT registration, unless waived by the Board of Examiners as part of the academic assessment. Technical reports for technologist level ITPs would also be required, unless previously waived by the Board, to be completed within the ‘Provisional’ time period of five years and before the ‘Provisional’ status is removed. The intent is to have the technical report reflect their Canadian experience.

> This process for ITPs in no way degrades our current standards of membership and identifies for employers potential employees who have met the basic standards for ASTTBC certified membership. Employers will be readily able to identify that these individuals from their resumes, which employers would require to be supplied during the hiring process, and the ‘Provisional’ designation.
