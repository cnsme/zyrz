## CDHBC ##

The College of Dental Hygienists of British Columbia (CDHBC) was established as a self-regulating body on March 1, 1995, under the Health Professions Act (HPA)

CDHBC is responsible for establishing, monitoring, and enforcing standards that assure safe, ethical, and competent dental hygiene care. This includes registration of all dental hygienists in British Columbia, setting standards of practice for dental hygienists, and investigating complaints against dental hygienists.

## Clinical Examination ##

Foreign-trained dental hygienists and recent graduates of unaccredited programs and/or educational facilities not approved by the College (approved programs are listed in [Schedule I](http://www.cdhbc.com/Practice-Resources/Regulation-and-Bylaws/Schedules/Schedule-I-Dental-Hygiene-Programs.aspx)) must successfully complete the CDHBC Clinical Examination before being eligible for registration, unless the applicant has passed a dental hygiene clinical exam in another Canadian jurisdiction or is/has been registered in good standing within Canada (contact the College for more information).

Candidates are examined for safe, entry-level clinical competence over the course of one and a half days; all sections of the examination must be passed to be successful.

### Timeline

The B.C. Dental Hygiene Clinical Examination is offered once per year in July, and will be offered in the Spring and Fall as long as a minimum of three applications are received prior to the deadline.

Seating is limited, so applicants are encouraged to contact the College well in advance of the application deadline to reserve a space.

#### Next Testing Session

The next testing session will be: **November 28 ****& 29, 2015**

Deadline to apply: **October 16, 2015**

### Requirements to Apply

Requirements be submitted four weeks prior to the examination date.

Clinical examination applicants must provide:

- Proof of graduation from a dental hygiene program
- Proof of successful completion of the [National Dental Hygiene Certification Board](http://www.ndhcb.ca/en/index.php) examination
- A completed [2015 Clinical Exam Application Form](http://www.cdhbc.com/Documents/2015-Clinical-Exam-Application-Form.aspx)
- [2015 Clinical Exam Info Guide](http://www.cdhbc.com/Documents/Clinical-Exam-Info-Guide-2015.aspx)
- Examination fee by the application deadline
- Proof of Negligence Insurance

Complete payment must be received along with the application form; the fee is non-refundable after the application deadline.

For more details, including fees and an outline of the exam format, refer to the Clinical Examination Information Guide.

### Providing a Client

Each candidate is responsible for providing a client who is able to attend for the entire exam session. Failure to provide a suitable client results in failure of the exam, so it is imperative for each candidate to ensure that the client meets the client criteria.

Because the candidate is not permitted to have prior knowledge of the client’s oral condition, CDHBC recommends consulting at least one registered dental hygienist to evaluate whether the client criteria is fulfilled, although this does not guarantee acceptability.

It is also important to determine whether the client has any physical issues which may cause discomfort during long periods of sitting and oral examinations.

If a client fails to appear or is deemed to be inappropriate for the examination, the candidate will be unable to proceed with the exam unless a suitable replacement is available. Please note that CDHBC employees and examiners are unable to assist in finding clients. For this reason, it is best to pre-screen at least two clients in case of disqualification or extenuating circumstances. As time allows, examiners will assess all of the available clients; however, no allowance will be made for late arrivals.

### Areas of Study

The CDHBC Clinical Exam includes evaluation of health and dental history; extra-oral, intra-oral, periodontal, and deposit assessments; implementation (ultrasonic, debridement); radiographic interpretation, including technique critique and interpretation of images; infection control management; safe practice for common medical conditions; professionalism; and completion of the diagnosis and treatment plan.

6.  The College will pay the practitioner performing the remedial treatment up to a maximum of $150.00 based on the current fees.

### 3.  EXAMINATION FORMAT ###

The examination has been developed and reviewed by a group of practicing dental hygienists, including clinicians and educators. The examination represents the basic knowledge and skills needed to practice safely and competently as a dental hygienist in British Columbia.

The main emphasis of the Clinical Examination is on the roles of clinician, health promoter and educator. The Process of Dental Hygiene Care Model, including assessment, dental hygiene diagnosis, planning, implementation and evaluation, forms the theoretical framework for the examination procedures. A comprehensive explanation of this model is found in _Dental Hygiene Theory and Practice_, by Darby and Walsh (see 7, Resources).

The examination is offered over two days: The first day is approximately 4 hours and includes a client screening/approval, _Section I: Health Assessment_ and _Section II: Radiographic Interpretation_. The second day is a full day in the clinic with a client, who should be prepared to arrive by 8am and stay until 5:30pm (or later).

Please note: _The candidate orientation is mandatory_ (schedule will be provided).

The Clinical Examination is divided into the following sections:

**I: Health Assessment** <span class="p">(total of 30 minutes, Day 1)</span>

Includes interpretation of the client's medical/dental history, questions about the implications of common medical conditions for dental care, and blood pressure.

**II: Radiographic Interpretation** <span class="p">(15 minutes, Day 1)</span>

Review of two or three client radiographs provided by examiners to include a critique of taking/processing techniques and an interpretation of the images.

**III: Tissue & Deposit Assessment** <span class="p">(2 hours, Day 2)</span>

Includes extra-oral assessment, intra-oral assessment, periodontal assessment, dental assessment, occlusal assessment and deposit assessment.

**IV: Dental Hygiene Diagnosis & Treatment Planning** (40 minutes _written_, 30 minutes _verbal_, Day 2)

This section also includes obtaining informed consent. The instrumentation area will be assigned by an examiner.

**V: Instrumentation** <span class="p">(1 hour and 45 minutes, Day 2)</span>

Includes an evaluation of ultrasonic (or equivalent) instrumentation, hand instrumentation, debridement (scaling, root planing), post-treatment tissue condition and a self assessment. Local anesthesia can be requested. (Fluoride can be applied by the candidate in their own time at the end of the examination, after instrumentation has been evaluated, if desired.)

**VI: Clinic Support** <span class="p">(throughout the Clinical Examination)</span>

Includes client comfort management, infection control, documentation and records, safety, time management, and professionalism. Candidates are expected to wear appropriate clinic attire and clinic shoes.

Candidates must successfully complete all sections of the Clinical Examination to pass. The document <span class="s4">Criteria for Competence</span> offers a detailed breakdown of the exam content and requirements for proficiency.

### 4.  CLIENTS ###

Candidates are responsible for providing a suitable client. One adult client and at least one back-up client must be able to attend at the beginning of the exam session (approximately 3 hours) to be evaluated by the examiners for consideration as a client

for the second day of in-clinic testing _(approximately 9 hours with breaks; see the provided schedule)_. **Please request that your back-up client(s) wait until dismissed
or until notified that an alternate client has been approved.**

Specific client criteria are required in order to assess the candidate's clinical competence. <span class="p">Criteria for client suitability are:</span>

- has been examined by a B.C. dentist within the previous 365 days
- minimum age of 18
- minimum total of 16 teeth, with teeth in at least three quadrants; including one molar
- moderate amounts of subgingival calculus in at least eight teeth, distributed in both the maxillary and mandibular arches
- light supragingival calculus in at least one sextant
- pockets 5 mm or greater around at least two teeth, including a molar, with calculus present in the pockets
- physically able to undergo a full day of dental hygiene assessment and treatment (ie. will not suffer excessive discomfort due to physical limitations such as TMD, back pain, etc.)
- blood pressure reading within an acceptable range

To participate in the exam, a client must meet the criteria. <span class="p">To ensure suitability the candidate should obtain a current medical history, have a registered dental hygienist do a screening check to verify that the client meets the examination criteria, and obtain a signed statement by the client verifying that a dental examination has been performed by a B.C. dentist within the previous 365 days (the Client Release Form).</span>

Clients cannot be members of the dental profession.

Candidates should not have full detailed knowledge of the client’s intra -oral <span class="s1"></span> condition and should not have reviewed previous charting or client records. <span class="s1"></span> <span class="p">If the client’s English is limited, the candidate should ensure that an interpreter is available during the examination.</span>

<span class="p">If clients brought to the examination do not meet the stated criteria and are not suitable to assess the candidate's clinical skills, or are not medically suitable for dental hygiene care, or have not had a dental examination by a B.C. dentist within the previous 365 days, they will be disqualified as exam clients. An acceptable alternative client needs to be available in enough time for the candidate to continue with the examination as scheduled.</span> Inability to provide a suitable client will result in disqualification from <span class="s1"></span> the examination<span class="s4">.</span> <span class="p">An alternative/back-up client is strongly suggested if a candidate is unsure of the client's acceptability or reliability.</span>

Clients should be made aware of the intent and nature of the examination, and the fact that only some of their dental hygiene needs will be met during their one day in clinic. _**Pre-screening for back problems or other pain issues is recommended due to the length of time the client will be seated.** _The client should know that a whole day will be required for this exam and that there will be multiple examinations and probings by the examiners. If client radiographs are available, candidates are advised to bring them to the examination to assist with assessment, dental hygiene diagnosis, planning and implementation. If radiographs are not provided by the client, there will be an opportunity to request them during the examination.

The CDHBC, its staff or examiners cannot assist candidates in obtaining clients <span class="s1"></span> before or during the examination.

The best sources for clients include:

-   friends, relatives, acquaintances
-   newspaper advertisements
-   posted notices in education institutions, seniors centres, etc.

### 5. SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT ###

The examination facility will be a modern, fully equipped dental clinic. Please advise the College office if you require equipment that accommodates left-handed operators.

Candidates are responsible for supplying:

- all hand instruments
- gloves, masks, and oral hygiene supplies*
- bib chain
- hand mirror
- pens
- dappen dishes/finger cups
- visual aids
- sharpening stone and test stick
- as well as any other supplies, equipment, and instruments needed to complete the procedures outlined for the examination.

 For example, screw-type prophy angles are not available, but may be used if brought by the candidate.

Candidates may bring their own ultrasonic (or equivalent) units and tips to the examination. Please check with the College office to ensure the water attachment or tips are compatible.

 *Note: The examination may be held in a latex-free environment. Please check with the College office regarding whether latex supplies are permitted at the examination facility.

 All instruments brought to the examination must be sterilized<span class="p">. There is not time to sterilize instruments prior to the examination. After the examination, clinic staff will clean the instruments in an ultrasonic, rinse, dry and bag them for candidates but will not have time to re-sterilize the instruments before the clinic is closed.</span>

The following supplies and equipment are available for candidates:

- client examination charts and records
- blood pressure cuff/stethoscope
- thermometers - disposable type, with numerical readout (Celsius)
- complete radiography equipment and supplies, and processing facilities
- topical anaesthetic
- self-aspirating anesthetic syringes, needles and a variety of anesthetic agents, needle guards
- magnetostrictive ultrasonic units (manufacturer’s instructions for each assigned unit will be available during the Clinic Orientation)
- universal magnetostrictive ultrasonic tips and a selection of Beavertail, chisel and probe tips
- kleenex, gauze, cotton rolls, Q-tips, bibs, gloves
- surface disinfectant

The facility provides double-ended explorers and colour-coded periodontal probes for the examiners’ use. Candidates may also use these instruments. Both instruments must be returned to the clinic staff at the end of the examination.

### 6.  CLINICAL PROCEDURES ###

Detailed examination information, including a schedule, orientation guide and Criteria for Competence (_see below_), will be sent to candidates to assist with preparation for the exam.

During the Clinic Orientation and Examination Orientation, candidates will have an opportunity to ask questions and clarify information.

Examiners will be using the International Tooth Numbering System.

The Clinical Examination is divided into sections, and _**candidates are required to complete all sections** _within a specified time period. Times will be strictly adhered to. Some procedures are evaluated at their completion; others are evaluated while they are being performed and also at completion. Candidates will be asked to leave the clinic area while the examiners independently evaluate each section. Candidates are examined for safe, professional, entry-level clinical competence.

<span class="p">Examiners evaluate each procedure by comparing the candidate's practice to specific written criteria. These criteria are listed in the document Criteria for Competence.</span> The document "Criteria for Clinical Competence" <u>must not</u> be brought into the clinic.

Examiners have the responsibility to dismiss any client and candidate from the Clinical Examination if the examiners judge the client or any other participant is at risk.
