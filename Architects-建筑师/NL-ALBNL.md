## 国外受训建筑师BEFA - Foreign-Trained Architects ## 飞出国

有广泛经验的外国建筑师（BEFA）项目简化了在加拿大成为注册建筑师的过程。

BEFA项目根据加拿大建筑师执业能力全国标准对具有丰富经验的外国建筑师进行评估。

满足BEFA项目要求的外国建筑师可以申请BEFA认证，认证过程包括在线自评和面试，面试的是持有执照的建筑师。

一旦申请人成功通过了BEFA认证过程，会授予BEFA证书。有了这个证书，就表示申请人已经满足了加拿大省或领地执照机构规定的学历、工作经验和考试等方面的注册要求。有了BEFA证书，就可以申请打算执业的省或领地的执业证书了。

> 
> The BEFA program assesses broadly based experience of foreign architects against Pan-Canadian standards of competency for practice in Canada.

> Once an applicant has successfully completed the BEFA process, they will be granted a BEFA certificate. When BEFA Certification is issued by CACB, it will serve as a recommendation for recognition as an equivalent to successful completion of the Canadian Education, Experience, and Examination Standards that are in place for licensure by a provincial or territorial licensing body. With the BEFA Certificate, you can apply for licensure to the Provincial/Territorial Association you have chosen to register with.
