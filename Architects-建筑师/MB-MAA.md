## 建筑专业实习 (IAP) - 飞出国 ##

建筑专业是一个授权专业，需要进行大量实习。加拿大10个省级建筑师协会都采用IAP这个标准流程筛选新晋专业人士。IAP主要由3个部分构成：学历、工作经验和考试。

申请建筑实践许可/注册时，必须顺利通过这三项。

### 学历

建筑专业学历必须获得加拿大建筑学认证委员会或美国国家建筑学鉴定委员会认证。

如果你无法获得大学全日制教育学历，可以通过参与RAIC大纲计划满足学历要求。RAIC大纲计划是一个专业文凭自学项目，其中包含学术学习、设计课程和实践经验。

如果学历是**非认证学历**，比如：在其他地方完成学业或者完成学业之后所在加拿大大学相关学历项目才获得认证，此时，必须向CACB递交学历证书，接受CABC的详细评估，以确定该学历是否满足加拿大学历标准。

符合下列条件的申请者符合保留条款：在1976年7月1日之前通过某个省建筑师协会注册或许可；在1992年之前通过OAQ的注册或许可；拥有艾伯塔UCC认证。

### 工作经验

**IAP经验**是一种定期记录和评估实习活动的国家标准体系，为正式学历和注册/许可提供一种结构化过渡，使实习生可以获得足够的工作经验，达到专业实践标准。该项目还鼓励有经验的实践者更多参与到发展未来同事之中。

每个实习生都有**雇主**和**导师**。雇主每天都监督和指导实习生；而导师本身是一名建筑师，不在实习生工作范围之内，主要负责指导他们。

每个实习生都必须在一个认可的工作环境中参与具体建筑实践并获得不少于3720个小时的强制性工作经验。

工作经验必须记录在实习项目手册中的**加拿大经验记录簿**上，且该经验表格必须得到雇主和导师的签字。

只有学历资格获得加拿大建筑认证委员会认证，才可以申请注册实习生，这也是CACB或NAAB认证项目毕业生申请注册实习生的一种直接方式。

RAIC大纲计划有效会员在完成第一步之后可以以MAA学生会员身份记录工作经验。

### 考试

为了符合建筑师许可条件，所有的申请者都必须通过一个相关职业考试。加拿大所有地区都有两种相关职业考试。在曼尼托巴，只有MAA实习会员才可以参加ARE或ExAC。

#### ARE

建筑师注册考试由NCARB和CALA共同负责，旨在对参试者在提供建筑服务方面的能力进行评估。

ARE是一种计算机专属考试，在美国和加拿大各个考试中心都有分布。参加考试之前，不需要满足任何具体工作经验要求，该考试在加拿大和美国以外的地方也同样受到认可。

ARE共有如下7个版块：

- 规划、计划&实践
- 场地规划&设计
- 建筑设计&建设系统
- 方案设计
- 结构体系
- 建筑系统
- 施工文件&服务

MAA办公处提供ARE学习资料，NCARB官网提供免费辅导软件——考试指南与ARE模拟考试

更多信息:

- [建筑师注册考试 (ARE)](http://www.ncarb.org/ARE.aspx)

#### ExAC

加拿大建筑师考试由安大略建筑师协会、魁北克建筑师协会和艾伯塔建筑师协会共同负责，旨在检测实习生在实习阶段已获得的最低标准的能力，确保其可以保障公共安全，可以熟练地提供专业建筑服务。该考试在2008年秋天第一次实行，目前加拿大所有省级/地区协会都已经用该考试取代ARE。

ExAC是一种纸质考试。所有实习生在加拿大经验记录簿记录的工作经验都不能少于2800个小时，且必须将该工作经验递交给加拿大某个省级/地区协会，并获得其认可，才可以参加ExAC。该考试是整个加拿大都认可的一种考试。

ExAC共有4个版块，必须在连续2天内通过，具体版块如下所示：

- ExAC Section 1
- ExAC Section 2
- ExAC Section 3
- ExAC Section 4

MAA办公处提供ExAC学习资料。

> ## Internship in Architecture Program (IAP) ##
> 
> Architecture is a licensed profession, requiring extensive training. The ten provincial associations of architects in Canada have adopted a standardized process for admission to the profession known as the Internship in Architecture Program (IAP). The IAP (also called the Intern Program) has three components:
> 
> - Education
> - Experience
> - Examination
> 
> These three components must be completed successfully before a candidate can apply for a license/registration to practice architecture.
> 
> - Licencing / Registration
> 
> The Royal Architectural Institute of Canada (RAIC) has published useful materials for people interested in a career in architecture. Click here to learn more about the profession, or read about a typical day in the life of an architect.
> 
> ### Education
> 
> The Education component most commonly involves the completion of a **professional degree in architecture** program at schools accredited by the Canadian Architectural Certification Board (CACB) or by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB) in the USA.
> 
> Individuals who are unable to attend university full time can complete the education requirement through the **Royal Architectural Institute of Canada (RAIC) Syllabus Program**. The RAIC Syllabus Program is a self-paced professional diploma program of academic studies, design studios, and practical experience.
> 
> Candidates who hold a **non-accredited degree** (by completing their education elsewhere or at a Canadian university prior to accreditation of the degree program) must submit their academic qualifications to the CACB for a detailed evaluation to determine whether the requirements of the Canadian Education Standard have been satisfied.
> 
> Candidates who were registered or licensed by a provincial association of architects **prior to July 1, 1976 (or by the OAQ prior to 1992)** or who have certification by the UCC in Alberta, are eligible under a grandfathering clause.

> ### Experience
> 
> The Experience component of the IAP is a standardized national system for periodic documentation and evaluation of internship activities. It provides a structured transition between formal education and registration/licensing, allowing the Intern to gain sufficient experience to meet professional standards of practice. The program also encourages experienced practitioners to become more involved in the development of their future colleagues.
> 
> Interns have an **Employer** and a **Mentor**. The Employer supervises and directs the Intern on a daily basis, while the Mentor is an architect outside the Intern's place of employment who acts in an advisory capacity to the Intern.
> 
> An Intern must complete a minimum of 3,720 hours of mandatory experience in specified areas of architectural practice, in an approved employment setting.
> 
> Experience must be documented in the **Canadian Experience Record Book**, which is included with the Intern Program manual. The experience forms must be signed by the Employer and Mentor.
> 
> To enroll as an Intern, an individual's academic qualifications must be certified by the Canadian Architectural Certification Board (CACB). This is a straightforward process for graduates of a CACB or NAAB accredited program.
> 
> Candidates who are actively enrolled in the RAIC Syllabus Program are also eligible to start logging experience as a Student Member of the MAA once they have completed Part 1 of the RAIC Syllabus Program.

> 
> ### Examination
> 
> To be eligible for licencing as an architect, all candidates must successfully complete a slate of professional examinations. Interns in all jurisdictions in Canada have a choice of two different examination streams. In Manitoba, you must be an Intern Member of the MAA to be eligible to sit for either the ARE or the ExAC.
> 
> #### ARE
> 
> The Architect Registration Examination (ARE) is developed jointly by the National Council of Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB) and the Canadian Architectural Licencing Authorities (CALA) and is intended to evaluate a candidate's competence to provide architectural services.
> 
> The ARE is administered exclusively on computers at a network of test centres across the United States and Canada. There is no specific experience requirement that must be met, prior to sitting for the ARE and it is recognized for licencing elsewhere in Canada and in the USA.
> 
> The ARE is now comprised of seven divisions, which may be written in any order, as follows:
> 
> - Programming, Planning & Practice
> - Site Planning & Design
> - Building Design & Construction Systems
> - Schematic Design
> - Structural Systems
> - Building Systems
> - Construction Documents & Services
> 
> Study materials for the ARE are available from the MAA office. Free tutorial software (Exam Guides and ARE Practice Programs) is available on the NCARB website.
> 
> More information:
> 
> - [Architect Registration Examination (ARE)](http://www.ncarb.org/ARE.aspx)
> 
> #### ExAC
> 
> The Examination for Architects in Canada (ExAC) was jointly developed by the Ontario, Quebec and Alberta Associations of Architects and is intended to test the minimum standards of competency acquired by an Intern during the Internship period, to ensure both public safety and the professional and skilled delivery of architectural service. It was delivered for the first time in fall of 2008 and all provincial/territorial associations in Canada have now adopted the examination as an alternative to the ARE.
> 
> The ExAC is administered in a paper and pencil format. Interns must have 2800 hours of experience recorded in the Canadian Experience Record Book and submitted for approval to one of the provincial/territorial associations in Canada, to be eligible to sit for the ExAC and it is recognized for licencing throughout Canada.
> 
> The ExAC is comprised for four sections, which must be completed over a period of two consecutive days, as follows:
> 
> - ExAC Section 1
> - ExAC Section 2
> - ExAC Section 3
> - ExAC Section 4

## 许可/注册 - 飞出国 ##

在满足三个基本的入会标准，即学历、经验和考试，之后，实习会员可以申请在曼尼托巴进行建筑实践的许可/注册。申请者必须查看有关加拿大建筑实践管理的具体文件。

只有MAA注册会员才可以在曼尼托巴进行建筑实践。许可/注册流程必须通过向MAA递交申请才可以完成。

### 加拿大互惠协议 ###

加拿大建筑许可机构之间的互惠协议自1992年1月1日起生效，为加拿大省级/地区协会注册或许可建筑师提供证书认可。只要申请者在其他地区没有任何和能力、行为或品行相关、可能影响公众利益的问题，就可以直接通过该协议成为某个相关协会的注册会员，不需要进一步接受审查或面试。

### 加拿大/美国互认协议 ###

NCARB与CCAC互认协议在1994年1月1日签订，为加拿大和美国各地区提供相互许可/认证。

持有与加拿大建筑师相关的NCARB证明的申请者通过该协议可以在美国相关地区直接获得建筑实践注册，不需提供任何其他资格证明，只需要提供熟悉当地法律、情况和实践要求的相关证明。

该协议仅适用于下列建筑师：持有NCARB证明；其主要实践地区是该协议的参与者。

### 加拿大和美国以外的申请者 ###

国外学历申请参考： http://www.mbarchitects.org/docs/Foreign%20Applicants(2013).pdf


## 加拿大和美国以外的申请者在加拿大获得建筑许可 ##

加拿大建筑专业既是一个自治专业又是一个自制专业。

省级地方立法或《建筑师法案》创立了11个独立的省级/地区建筑许可机构，其主要目的是许可或注册建筑师，确保其能够向公众提供合适的专业服务。

尽管大多数加拿大建筑师都是个体经营者，但是许多建筑公司、私人企业和政府部门还是会雇佣建筑师。如果你打算成为一名加拿大建筑师，必须获得相关省级/地区建筑协会许可或注册。

**Note:** 根据曼尼托巴省《建筑师法案》有关规定，如果你的建筑师身份不代表个人，那么，你即使不是协会注册会员，也可以：

-   执行该法律规定实践范围内的特定活动，前提是，你的雇佣团体必须有权在曼尼托巴省进行建筑实践，你必须在协会注册会员的指导和控制下进行实践；
-   提供服务，其涉及的建筑设计在该法律规定实践范围内；

曼尼托巴省实践范围相关信息，请访问：[曼尼托巴建筑师协会](http://www.mbarchitects.org/buildings_requiring_an_architect.php)。


### 在加拿大，获得建筑许可或注册需要满足三方面要求: ##

#### 1. 学历要求 ###

必须提供建筑专业学历或文凭。该学历或文凭必须满足加拿大学历标准，并获得CACB认证。CACB认证既不是建筑许可或注册也不是加拿大移民许可，它只是获得建筑许可或注册的其中一步。

CACB是唯一一个获得加拿大建筑专业认可的教育学历或学历资格评估机构。


#### 2. 经验要求 ###

所有申请者都必须实习一段时间才可以满足加拿大经验标准。加拿大经验记录簿中至少记录3720个小时的建筑实习项目 —— 其中包含各种强制性专业活动——经验，且该经验被省级/地区建筑协会所认可。在申请许可或注册之前，很可能还需要在相关省/地区获得一定工作经验。此外，在加拿大以外的地方获得工作经验很可能也符合要求。

#### 3. 考试要求 ###

所有申请者都必须顺利通过一个注册考试，才可以满足加拿大相关考试要求；注册考试有两个：ARE和ExAC，ARE共有7个板块，ExAC共有4个板块。

> 
> ## Licencing / Registration ##
> 
> Once the three Common Admission Standards (Education, Experience and Examination) have been satisfied, Intern Members may apply for a license/registration to practice architecture in Manitoba. Applicants must review certain documents governing the practice of architecture in Canada.
> 
> To practice architecture in Manitoba, you must become a Registered Member of the MAA. The licensing/registration process is completed through an application process with the MAA.
> 
> ### Canadian Reciprocity Agreement ###
> 
> The Reciprocity Agreement of Canadian Architectural Licensing Authorities has been in effect since January 1, 1992 and provides for the recognition of credentials of architects who are registered or licensed in one of the provincial/territorial associations in Canada. The Agreement allows applicants to be granted registered membership in a reciprocating association, without further examination or interview, provided that the applicant holds current membership in in a provincial/territorial association and there are no past or pending issues in another jurisdiction with respect to their competency, conduct or character, which might affect the public interest.
> 
> ### Inter-Recognition Agreement (Canada/USA) ###
> 
> The Inter-Recognition Agreement Between the National Council of Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB) and the Committee of Canadian Architectural Councils (CCAC) was signed on July 1, 1994 and provides for reciprocal licensing/registration among jurisdictions in Canada and the USA.
> The Agreement allows applicants who have obtained NCARB Certification (on the basis of terms defined for Canadian architects) to be granted registration to practice architecture in the participating jurisdictions in the USA, without any further demonstration of qualification, other than evidence of familiarity with local laws, conditions, and practice requirements.
> The Agreement applies only to those architects who have obtained NCARB Certification and whose principal place of practice is located within a jurisdiction that is a participant to the Agreement.
> 
> ### Foreign Applicants Outside Canada and The USA ###
> 
> For general information: [Requirements for Foreign Applicants](http://www.mbarchitects.org/docs/Foreign%20Applicants(2013).pdf)
> 
> 
> 国外学历申请参考： http://www.mbarchitects.org/docs/Foreign%20Applicants(2013).pdf
> ## For Foreign Applicants Outside Canada and USA Obtaining An Architectural Licence in Canada ##
> 
> 
> The architectural profession in Canada is both self-governing and self-regulating.
> 
> Provincial legislation or "Architects Acts" have created eleven independent provincial/territorial architectural licensing authorities whose primary purpose is the licensing or registration of architects to ensure their competency and ability to provide proper professional services to the public.
> 
> Most architects in Canada are self-employed; however, many architectural firms, private corporations and governments employ architects. In order to become an architect in Canada, you must obtain a licence or registration from the Provincial/Territorial Architectural Association in the province/territory where you intend to work.
> 
> **Note:** In accordance with The Architects Act in the Province of Manitoba, you are not required to be a registered member of the Association to:
> 
> -   perform certain activities that fall within the restricted scope of practice under the law, if you are employed in an entity that is authorized to practice architecture in the Province of Manitoba and you are acting under the direction and control of a registered member of the Association; or
> 
> -   offer services which involve the design of buildings which fall outside the restricted scope of practice under the law;
> 
> provided that you do not represent yourself as an architect.
> 
> Further information regarding the scope of practice that is restricted in the Province of Manitoba is available from the website of the Manitoba Association of Architects (MAA): [](http://www.mbarchitects.org/buildings_requiring_an_architect.php)[http://www.mbarchitects.org/buildings_requiring_an_architect.php](http://www.mbarchitects.org/buildings_requiring_an_architect.php)
> 
> ### In Canada, there are three major requirements for an architectural licence or registration: ##
> 
> #### 1.  Educational Requirements ###
> 
> A professional degree or diploma in architecture is required. This degree or diploma must be certified by the Canadian Architectural Certification Board (CACB) as meeting the Canadian Education Standard. A certificate from the CACB is not an architectural licence or registration nor a permit for immigration to Canada - it is only one part of a three-step process.
> 
> The CACB is the only body recognized by the architectural profession in Canada for the assessment of education qualifications or academic credentials.
> 
> #### 2.  Experience Requirements ###
> 
> All candidates must complete a period of internship to satisfy the Canadian Experience Standard. A minimum of 3720 hours of experience under the Internship in Architecture Program (which includes various mandatory professional activities) must be recorded in the Canadian Experience Record Book and accepted by the provincial/territorial architectural association. There may be a minimum amount of experience to be gained in the province/territory prior to licensure or registration. Experience gained outside Canada may be submitted for consideration.
> 
> #### 3. Examination Requirements ###
> 
> All candidates must successfully complete one of the two registration examination systems in order to satisfy the examination requirement; either the Architect Registration Examination (ARE), which consists of seven parts or divisions OR the Examination for Architects in Canada (ExAC) which is comprised of four components.

### 在加拿大申请建筑许可的步骤 - 飞出国

在加拿大申请建筑许可必须经过下列几个步骤：

 **第一步**- 学历资格评估流程

所有申请者都必须申请CACB学历资格认证，必须向CACB递交的信息包括：

- 完整申请表
- 与建筑学历相关的所有官方成绩单或相关认证，如果成绩单原件不是法语或英语文件，还需要提供翻译文件的认证复件
- 原版学历或文凭的认证复件，如果原语言不是法语或英语，还需要提供课程简介翻译文件
- 建筑专业项目课程简介，如果原语言不是法语或英语，还需要提供课程简介翻译文件
- 工作室工作学术历程记录
- 申请费：1779.75加元，其中包括增值税，只能使用加拿大汇票支付，不可以使用信用卡

在CACB评估过程中，申请者可能需要参加考试委员会安排的英语或法语面试，接受详细评估。如果申请者需要参加一个这样的面试，那么，加拿大移民机构将决定是否允许申请者获得签证。

评估之后可能产生的结果：


- 如果学历资格达到了加拿大学历标准，那么可以获得CACB证书；

- 需要进一步证明;

- 评估委员会根据递交的文件不能完成评估，必须参加一次面试；
- 申请者可能需要顺利完成CACB要求的课程，弥补某个具体方面中的不足；
- 学历资格不被认可。

**第二步** – 实习

申请者获得CACB证书之后，必须寻找一位导师，申请参与一个省级/地区建筑协会的建筑实习项目。虽然各省/地区实习会员年费不同，但是基本上都是100加元到226加元。

每个申请者都必须获得一份实习项目手册，因为他们必须使用其中的加拿大经验记录簿记录自己的工作经验，以满足该记录簿中的所有相关要求。此外，该工作经验必须接受相关省级/地区建筑协会的审查并获得其认可。申请者或许也可以递交在加拿大以外的地区获得的工作经验。

**曼尼托巴省相关信息:**

- 实习会员年费是157.5加元，其中包括增值税；

- 申请表以及导师与雇主表下载地址: [MAA](http://www.mbarchitects.org/intern_member.php)；

- 如果申请者自己不可以找到一位合适的导师，MAA办公处可以提供符合条件的注册会员，他们都已经同意担任导师；
- 根据《曼尼托巴建筑师法案》有关规定，经验要求的目的和**在曼尼托巴省进行建筑实践的能力**直接相关。《曼尼托巴建筑师法案》是也必须是MAA审查所有实习生（包括加拿大毕业生）递交的所有工作经验的指导原则。加拿大和美国以外地区的合格工作经验比较有限。**注意：**如果相关地区没有注册或许可要求，那么该工作经验很可能还需要考虑其他因素才会符合相关条件，甚至实习生可能需要提供其他文件和/或参见面试，证明该工作经验是通过在曼尼托巴进行实践获得的。通常情况下，申请者在参与建筑实习项目之前必须递交过去的工作经验，但是，具有国际教育背景的毕业生必须满足考试要求之后再递交过去的工作经验，因为在大多数情况下，只有获得加拿大工作经验才可以满足经验要求。更多文件递交信息，参见：加拿大经验记录簿。

**第三步** – 考试

所有申请者都必须通过一个相关考试：

1.  建筑师注册考试 (ARE).

ARE是一种计算机专属考试，在美国和加拿大各个考试中心都有分布。完成ARE所有版块共需要1470加元，有时需要支付一定的增值税。凡是持有CACB证书、是加拿大省级/地区建筑协会实习生的申请者都可以参加该考试。

2.  加拿大建筑师考试 (ExAC)

自2013年起，该考试由加拿大7个省级/地区协会共同管理。完成该考试所有版块共需要850加元，有些地区需要支付一定的增值税。所有的申请者都必须有不少于2800个小时的工作经验记录，且该工作经验已获得加拿大某个省级/地区协会认可时，才可以参加该考试。

### 曼尼托巴省相关基本信息: ###

#### 总成本/整体时间:

建筑专业注册流程每一步都有多项选择，所以，每个人（包括加拿大毕业生）的路径都不一样。相应地，由于个人情况的不同，具体注册流程中的决定和选择不同，每个人注册的成本和/或时间也就不一样。

#### MAA额外支持:

- MAA根据需要每2个月到3个月都会安排一次咨询会，以自己网站上提供的信息为基础，为具有国际教育背景的毕业生介绍许可申请流程。凡是有兴趣参加该咨询会的个人都可以联系MAA办公处。

- 尽管MAA不是一个职业介绍所，但是它确实可以为一些公司提供岗位聘任的机会，因为这些岗位适合MAA会员，包括建筑师、实习生和建筑专业学生。
详见: [http://www.mbarchitects.org/employment.php](http://www.mbarchitects.org/employment.php)

- MAA官方网站上的一个列表中包含所有在曼尼托巴省有建筑实践授权的法人团体，并附有公司简介和/或网站，详见: [http://www.mbarchitects.org/firm_search.php](http://www.mbarchitects.org/firm_search.php)

#### 政府额外支持:

- 尽管MAA或加拿大其他建筑机构提供的支持不包括为许可申请流程提供经济援助，但是，曼尼托巴省政府时常会提供一些经济援助。所以，申请者最好访问省政府官方网站，根据自己的具体情况，选择适合自己的援助类型：

1. [Recognition Counts!](http://seedwinnipeg.ca/programs/detail/recognition-counts)  (新贷款计划)

> ### Steps to Obtain an Architectural Licence in Canada
> 
> The following steps must be undertaken to obtain an architectural licence in Canada:
> 
> Note: Information which is specific to the Province of Manitoba appears in boxed areas below.
> 
>  **STEP ONE**- Process for Assessment of Academic Qualifications
> 
> Applicants must apply for certification of their academic qualifications through the Canadian Architectural Certification Board (CACB). The following information must be submitted directly to the CACB:
> 
> - a completed application (see address below to obtain an application form);
> 
> - an official Transcript of Record, or notarized copy thereof, of all studies relevant to the architecture degree (and certified copies of translated transcripts, if the original is not in French or English);
> 
> - notarized copies of degrees or diplomas in the original language (and a notarized copy of translation of the degree or diploma, if the original is not in French or English);
> 
> - course descriptions of the program in architecture (or a translation of course descriptions, if the original is not in French or English);
> 
> - an academic portfolio of studio work; and
> 
> - an application fee of C$1779.75 (included value added taxes) payable in Canadian funds only. Credit cards are not accepted.
> 
> An applicant may be required to attend an interview in English or French before a regional Committee of Examiners, for a detailed evaluation, as part of the assessment process by the CACB. If such an interview is required, the decision to grant a visa to the applicant is at the discretion of the Canadian immigration authorities.
> 
> The assessment process has the following possible outcomes:
> 
> - a CACB certificate may be issued if the academic qualifications meet the Canadian Education Standard;
> 
> - further clarfication is required;
> 
> - the Assessment Committee is unable to complete the assessment based on the documentation submitted and an interview is required;
> 
> - the applicant may be required to eliminate deficiencies in particular subject areas by successfully completing courses recommended by the CACB; or
> 
> - the academic qualifications may be rejected.
> 
> **STEP TWO** – Internship
> 
> After an applicant has obtained CACB certification, he or she must find a Mentor and apply to enroll in the Internship in Architecture Program with one of the eleven provincial/territorial architectural associations. Membership as an Intern costs between C$100 and C$226 (plus tax) annually depending on the province/terrority.
> 
> The Intern Program manual, which contains the Canadian Experience Record Book, must be obtained by each applicant. Each applicant must record work experience and satisfy the requirements of the Canadian Experience Record Book. The experience must be reviewed and accepted by the provincial/territorial architectural association. The applicant may submit experience gained outside Canada for consideration.
> 
> **The following information is relevant to the Province of Manitoba:**
> 
> - The cost of Intern membership is C$157.50 (including value added tax);
> 
> - The application form (and Mentor and Employer form) can be downloaded from the website of the Manitoba Association of Architects (MAA): [](http://www.mbarchitects.org/intern_member.php)[http://www.mbarchitects.org/intern_member.php](http://www.mbarchitects.org/intern_member.php)
> 
> - If a candidate is unable to find a suitable Mentor on their own, the MAA office can make a list of registered members who have agreed to serve as potential Mentors available;
> 
> - In accordance with The Architects Act in Manitoba, the intent of the experience requirement directly relates to _**competency to practice architecture in the Province of Manitoba**_. As such, this is and must be the guiding principle applied by the MAA, in reviewing any and all experience submissions from any and all Interns (including Canadian graduates). The extent of acceptable experience from outside Canada and the USA might be limited. It should also be noted that experience which has been gained in a jurisdiction where registration or licencing is not a requirement, will be considered on an even more restrictive case by case basis and the Intern may be required to provide further documentation and/or attend an interview, to clearly demonstrate its relevance to practice in Manitoba. In general, it is recommended that the submission of any past experience in another jurisdiction (which would have been completed prior to enrollment in the Internship in Architecture Program) be deferred until the examination requirements have been satisfied by an internationally educated individual, since the experience requirements are generally satisfied with Canadian employment by that time, in most cases. Further information concerning parameters for submission are included in the Canadian Experience Record Book.
> 
> **STEP THREE** – Examination
> 
> Applicants must also successfully complete one of the two examination systems that are now available in most jurisdictions in Canada:
> 
> 1.  The Architect Registration Examination (ARE).
> 
>         Examinations are administered exclusively on computers at a network of testing centres across Canada and the USA. The cost to take all nine divisions of the ARE is USD$1,470 (plus applicable value added taxes in Canada). Applicants may begin taking the examinations after obtaining CACB certification and enrolling as an Intern with one of the provincial/territorial architectural associations in Canada.
> 
> 2.  The Examination for Architects in Canada (ExAC)
> 
>         Effective 2013, examinations are administered by all eleven provincial/territorial associations in Canada. The cost to take all four components of the ExAC is C$850 (plus value added taxes in some jurisdictions). Applicants must have a minimum of 2,800 hours logged and approved by a provincial/territorial association in Canada, to be eligible to sit for the ExAC.
> 
> **The following information is relevant to the Province of Manitoba:**
> 
> - The cost of both examination systems are subject to the 5% value added tax;
> - The MAA maintains a library for its Intern members, which includes certain study material relevant to both the ARE and the ExAC (only Intern members may borrow the study material and there is no cost to do so, provided that the individual complies with the library policy).
> 
> ### Provincial/Territorial Associations Requirements
> 
> Applicants may also be required to comply with certain other requirements (such as ongoing continuing education requirements, an oral examination, an admission course, etc.) in order to maintain Intern membership or to become licensed or registered in certain provincial/territorial architectural associations. In order to practice architecture in a province/territory, it may be necessary to obtain a Certificate of Practice or its equivalent.
> 
>  Specific requirements may be obtained from the provincial/territorial architectural association.
> 
> Once the requirements for education, experience and examination have been satisfied (together with any additional requirements that might apply within a specific province/territory), an individual will be eligible to apply for licence or registration with the provincial/territorial architectural association. Membership costs between C$600 and C$931 (plus tax) annually depending on the province/territory.
> 
> **The following information is relevant to the Province of Manitoba:**
> 
> - Both Registered and Intern members of the MAA must comply with mandatory continuing education requirements. Further information regarding the current requirements is available on the MAA website: [](http://www.mbarchitects.org/mandatory_continuing_education.php)[http://www.mbarchitects.org/mandatory_continuing_education.php](http://www.mbarchitects.org/mandatory_continuing_education.php)
> 
> - There is no admissions course or oral examination administered as part of the registration process in the Province of Manitoba at this time. However, when making application for registered membership in the MAA, all individuals are required to swear a declaration that they have obtained detailed knowledge of the current Architects Act, MAA By-Laws, Code of Ethics, Builders Lien Act and Manitoba Building Code and Regulations;
> 
> - It is necessary to also register a practice in Manitoba, if a registered member wishes to offer services (and is not employed in a registered entity). Further information concerning the types of entities that can be authorized to practice architecture is available on the MAA website: [http://www.mbarchitects.org/register_a_practice.php](http://www.mbarchitects.org/register_a_practice.php%3B); and
> 
> - The cost of registered membership is C$840.00 (including value added tax).
> 
> **The fees, documentation and assessment process outlined above were in place as at January, 2013 are subject to change without notice.**
> 
> More detailed information may be obtained from the provincial/territorial architectural association.
> 
> Applications for certification of academic qualifications may be obtained from: 
> 
> The Canadian Architectural Certification Board
> 1 Nicholas Street, Suite 710 Ottawa, Ontario K1N 7B7, Canada

> 
> ### Additional Information ###
> 
> **Broadly Experienced Foreign Architect (BEFA) Program**
> 
> In September, 2012, the provincial/territorial associations in Canada introduced a streamlined assessment process for foreign-trained architects who have a minimum of seven (7) years post registration/licensure experience, together with a minimum of six months local experience in the relevant Canadian jurisdiction.
> 
> Further information concerning the alternate registration process is available on the CACB website: http://www.cacb- ccca.ca/index.cfm?M=3943&Repertoire_No=660386109&Voir=menu
> 
> 
> 
> ### The following general information is relevant to the Province of Manitoba: ###
> 
> #### Overall Cost/Timeframe:
> 
> - The registration process for the profession of architecture provides a multitude of options with respect to each step involved (education, experience and examination) and enables every individual, including every Canadian graduate, to follow their own unique path. Accordingly, the full range of costs and/or timeframe involved for each individual to become licenced, will be determined by their own unique circumstances (and all of the decisions and choices that have or will be made along the way).
> 
> #### Additional Support available through MAA:
> 
> - The MAA schedules an information session once every two to three months (depending on demand), to provide an overview of the licencing process for internationally educated graduates (based on the information available on its website). Those individuals who might be interested in participating should contact the MAA office.
> 
> - Although the MAA is not an employment agency, it does provide the opportunity for firms to post employment positions that might be of interest to members of the MAA (including architects, interns and architectural students). This information is readily available to everyone: [http://www.mbarchitects.org/employment.php](http://www.mbarchitects.org/employment.php)
> 
> - There is also a complete listing of any and all entities that are authorized to practice architecture in the Province of Manitoba, posted on the MAA’s website, and firms have been provided with the opportunity to include a limited firm profile and/or a link to their own website: [http://www.mbarchitects.org/firm_search.php](http://www.mbarchitects.org/firm_search.php)
> 
> #### Additional Support available through Government:
> 
> - The support provided by the MAA (and other architectural organizations in Canada) does not extend to the offer of any financial assistance towards the licencing process. However, the provincial government in Manitoba does, from time to time, offer some form of financial assistance. It is recommended that individuals visit the provincial government website, to determine what assistance might be available, depending on their individual circumstances:
