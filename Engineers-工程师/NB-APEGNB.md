## 受训人员指南 ##

### 引言

**新不伦瑞克专业工程师和地球科学家协会**负责管理该省所有专业工程师和专业地球科学家。根据《工程和地球科学专业法案和规章》的规定，**新不伦瑞克专业工程师和地球科学家协会**必须保护公众利益，专业工程师和专业地球科学家必须履行与公众、同事和雇主相关的义务。此外，《工程和地球科学专业法案和规章》对新不伦瑞克工程和地球科学实践进行了相关规定。强烈建议所有受训工程师和受训地球科学家（或受训人员）都应该拥有这些文件的副本。

工程和地球科学专业要有持续的竞争力，不断提高在该领域的全面实践。专业工程师或专业地球科学家将决定自己是否需要进行必要的培训才可以完成规定的任务。如果觉得自己接受的培训有限，可以把该任务留给该领域内其他有能力的专业人员。因此，工程专业和地球科学专业是两个自我限制专业。

因此，实习人员需要工作一段时间，不仅获得一定经验，还可以把所学知识付诸实践，反过来，这也有利于他们更好地了解特定任务的要求，并根据自己的资质做出更好的判断。

因此，新不伦瑞克专业工程师和地球科学家协会专门出版并发行了一个有关受训人员实习阶段必须具备的工作经验的纲要，该文件主要针对3个群体：

- 受训人员
- 负责监督或指导受训人员的专业工程师或专业地球科学家
- 受训人员的雇主

该文件旨在阐明工程和/或地球科学工作经验要求。

### 框架

该指南旨在呈现一个框架，指出哪些是符合工程/地球科学的工作经验，该框架不是基于算分系统。为有效评估受训人员的工作经验，必须遵循下列标准：

- 该工作经验必须是全面的。尽管合格工作经验必须涉及到这5个方面，但是，有些实习人士可能无法获得全部的工作经验
- 受训人员一定要认识到自己在工程/地球科学实践方面的局限
- 对于比较复杂、任务较重的工作，受训人员必须报告其进度

该指南的下一部分会更详细地介绍该框架下的每一个板块

工程/地球科学实践经验可以分为多种不同类别。受训人员应该参与不同类别的相关工作，直接获得全面的工作经验。


**注意:** 尽管合格工作经验必须涉及到这5个方面，但是，有些实习人士可能无法获得全部的工作经验。


**地球科学具体实例会显示加粗字体。**

>## Member-In-Training Complete Guide ##

>### Introduction

>The Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of New Brunswick is charged with the regulation of all Professional Engineers (P.Eng.’s) and Professional Geoscientists (P.Geo.’s) in the Province. The Association is obligated to protect the public as defined in the Engineering and Geoscience Professions Act and Bylaws. Secondly, the individual responsibilities of Professional Engineers and Professional Geoscientists toward the general public, their colleagues, and their employer are also defined by the regulations set out by the Act and Bylaws. Together, these documents serve to define the practice of engineering and geoscience in New Brunswick. It is strongly advised that all Engineers-in-Training (EIT’s) and Geoscientists-in-Training (GIT’s) (or Members-in-Training) obtain a copy of these documents.

>The engineering and geoscience professions expect a certain level of continued competency in order to improve the overall practice in the field. It is up to the P.Eng. or P.Geo. to decide whether he/she has the necessary training to complete a given task. If the P.Eng. or P.Geo. believes that he/she does not have sufficient training, it is up to the individual to leave the task for a more qualified professional in his/her field. Thus, engineering and geoscience are self-regulating professions.

>For this reason, a minimum period of work experience is required for the Member-in-Training (MIT) to not only gain experience but also to apply his/her knowledge in the field. This will in turn allow the MIT to understand what is required of them for certain tasks and allow them to make sound judgments based on their own personnel qualifications.

>We believe that this level of judgment can only be attained through direct association with one or more professional colleagues.

>For this reason, the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of New Brunswick decided to publish and distribute an outline of the type of experience that we deem necessary during the MIT training stage. This document is meant for three principal groups:

>*   The Member-in-Training (MIT)
*   The P.Eng. or P.Geo. who acts as a supervisor or mentor for the MIT 
*   The MIT’s employer

>This document aims to help clarify the requirements for the engineering and/or geoscience work experience.

>### Framework

>This guide aims to present a framework for what is considered acceptable engineering/geoscience work experience. This framework is not done on a point system. In order to effectively evaluate an MIT’s work experience, the following criteria must be followed:

>-   It should be a well rounded work experience program. Some experience in each of the 5 categories is highly desirable; however, it is recognized that some MIT’s may not be fully exposed to all of the 5 categories.
-   It is important that the MIT acquire an understanding of his/her limitations related to the practice of engineering/geoscience. 
-   The MIT must show a progression into work of greater complexity and responsibility.

>Each area of the framework will be explored in more detail in the next section of the guide.

>Experience in the practice of engineering/geoscience may be divided into a number of distinct categories. MIT’s should be exposed to, and gain hands-on experience with, each of these categories covered within the following broad framework to get a well-rounded work experience program.

>**NOTE:** Some experience in each of the 5 categories is highly desirable, however, it is recognized that some MIT’s may not be fully exposed to all of the five categories.

>Geoscience specific examples will be **bolded**.

>1.  Practical Experience
2.  Application of Theory
3.  Management
4.  Communication Skills 
5.  Social Implications

>#### Practical Experience

>After obtaining their bachelor degrees where theories are applied in laboratory settings, Members-in-Training (MIT’s) should be put in contact with the practical limits that define their specialty. It is only by using both the application of theory and practical experience together that they can reach they goal, the “best preservation of the natural resources to the benefit of humanity.” (Britannica)

>The Association recommends that Practical Experience should include, but not necessarily be limited to the following categories:

>Exposure to engineering/geoscience works through:

>-   Field work
-   Trips and visits to equipment or systems in both the operational and maintenance modes during the manufacturing or construction **(including exploration camps, drilling rigs, mines, quarries, geophysical exploration projects, environmental assessment projects, and soil & ground-water exploration and remediation projects.)**

>Application of the component as post of the larger system including:

>-   Understanding the end product of engineering/geoscience work and the means to achieve it.
-   Understanding the requirement for reliability 
-   Understanding the role of computer software to the total engineering/geoscience work

>Limitations:

>- Productions and/or construction
- Value engineering 
- Tolerances of manufacture 
- Maintenance philosophy 
- Performance minimums
- Tradesperson's/craftsperson's ability to produce, including exposure to the craftsperson's and the end uses 
- The relationship between software and equipment as the system operator 
- **The effects of climate and weather, scheduling, logistics, financial and budgetary constraints, and regulatory consideration on the implementation of geoscience programs, as well as the practical limits of geoscience techniques, and the development of reasonable expectations for the performance of equipment, systems, and people engaged in geoscience projects.**

>Timeframes:

>- Work flow process
- Wear out/replacement schedules

>**Surveying and Mapping**

>#### Application of Theory

>To become a P.Eng. or P.Geo., the MIT must be able to apply the technical training learned through the study of engineering/geoscience theory to engineering/geoscience projects, so that optimal solutions are developed and implemented. It is important to gain a varied exposure to engineering/geoscience experience.

>While enrolled as an MIT, it is important that the MIT acquire engineering/geoscience experience that touches on different techniques so that the MIT is exposed to more than simply routine situations. It is through this approach that the MIT will add to his or her skill and knowledge set. This will also demonstrate to the MIT the necessity of keeping up to date with emerging technologies in his or her field.

>A representative list of activities to which an MIT could apply learned theory might include:

>Analysis:

>- Scope and operating conditions;
- Compatibility and interface issues;
- Technological assessment; 
- Safety and environmental factors or issues; 
- Economic assessment.

>Design:

- **Mapping and systematic geoscience evaluations (with specific reference to bedrock, unconsolidated earth materials, and/or snow, ice, ground-water, surface water and constituents thereof) **
- **Identification of geological hazards and the risk to the public and the environments**

>#### Management

>Management covers a wide area of an engineer’s/geoscientist’s work, and it is not only the supervision of staff. Project management, including the social management of the technology, is an essential part of an engineer’s/geoscientist’s knowledge base.

>The following components of management experience should be taken as a representative framework:

>Planning:

>- Concept development;
- Identification of requirements; 
- Assessing the resources required and available. 
- **Acquisition of the necessary permits and clearances from responsible authorities**

- Product performance; 
- Social and environmental impacts; 
- Field conditions at geoscience projects 
- Economic impacts.

>#### Communication Skills

>The rapid expansion of technology has made it more and more important to be able to communicate effectively. This applies to all aspects of the work environment, and includes communication with employers, employees, government regulators, clients and the general public. It is important that a professional engineer/geoscientist be able to communicate concerning his or her work both orally and in written form. Typical forms of communication for the practicing engineer/geoscientist include:

>Written Reports:

>- An MIT should be given an opportunity to prepare written reports (including record keeping), including participation in larger reporting tasks being undertaken by the organization or unit in which he or she works.

>Oral Reporting:

>- This form of communication may include reports to superiors; reports to senior management; or exposure to, or participation in, reports to clients or regulatory authorities.

>Public Speaking:

>- If the opportunity arises, an MIT should be exposed to, or allowed to participate in, presentations on behalf of the organization to the public.

>Communication with Fellow Employees:

>- Opportunities should be given for an MIT to communicate information on behalf of the organization to other employees. It is important to communicate directly to the MIT comments on his or her progress, and to suggest to him or her seminars or other means of improving his or her skills.

>**For, the GIT, the candidate should also demonstrate proficiency in the ability to present ideas in the form of geological maps, cross-sections, and other geoscience drawings.**

>#### Social Implications of Engineering & Geoscience

>An important facet of the engineering and geoscience professions is an understanding of the social implications of engineering works. This understanding should include:

>- An awareness of an engineer’s/geoscientist's professional responsibility to guard against all conditions dangerous or threatening to life, limb or property, and to call any such conditions to the attention of the responsible.
- An awareness of potential impacts, both positive and negative, of the projects with which the engineer/geoscientist is involved. This should include an understanding of:  
     - the safeguards in place to protect the public and mitigate adverse impacts;  
     - the quality assurance measures involved with the manufacture of products;  
     - an awareness of the value of engineering works and/or geoscience to the public;  
     - an understanding of the safety and/or economic consequences to both the public and employer/client of the work being carried out;  
     - knowledge of the interface between the engineering/geoscience organization and the public when communicating the impacts and benefits of engineering/geoscience works, and or a recognition of the significant role of regulatory agencies in the practice of geoscience, and  
     - a demonstrated interest in the wider social implications of engineering/geoscience, through attendance at public meetings, or seminars sponsored by the MIT’s organization.

>### Registration Process

>This section briefly describes the process which an MIT must follow to become registered as a P.Eng. or P.Geo. in New Brunswick.

>The steps to becoming registered are:

>1.  Completion of an undergraduate degree in engineering or geoscience from an accredited university program or other academic or technical institution recognized by APEGNB's Council. Applicants who do not have a undergraduate degree which is recognized by Council may write a series of examinations as determined by the Board of Examiners.
2.  A completed application form for Professional Engineer or Professional Geoscientist designation returned to APEGNB. 
3.  Successful completion of the Professional Practice Exam. 
4.  Four years of acceptable engineering or geoscience experience. ALL 48 months must be attested by a P.Eng. or a P.Geo. who has direct knowledge of the work experience. (The Logbook and/or Mentorship program are designed to facilitate this.) 
5.  A minimum of three (3) references from P.Eng.’s or P.Geo.’s. 
6.  Approval of application for P.Eng./P.Geo. status by the Admissions Committee, and ratification by APEGNB’s Council.

>Application forms are available at the APEGNB office at 183 Hanwell Road, Fredericton, New Brunswick, or on this website under “Applications”, or by emailing [<span>info</span>@<span>apegnb.com</span>](mailto:info@apegnb.com). Staff are able to help with the application process. The telephone number of the office is (506) 458-8083.

>Four (4) years of experience minimum in engineering or geoscience must be completed before application for P.Eng./P.Geo. status can be made. It is essential that all 48 months be attested to by a registered P.Eng. or P.Geo. At least one of the engineers or geoscientists should be registered with APEGNB.

>It is preferable that the Member-in-Training works under the direct supervision of a P.Eng. or P.Geo. during his or her usual work. This supervisor is then well set up to act as a reference to this experience . In cases where the MIT does not work under the usual supervision of a P.Eng. or P.Geo., it behooves the MIT to join the Mentorship Program. (For information on this program, contact Stamatia Baker at [<span>stamatia</span>@<span>apegnb.com</span>](mailto:stamatia@apegnb.com) or call 506 458-8083.)

>### Role of the Admissions Committee ###

>The Admissions Committee of APEGNB plays a fundamental role in the attestation of engineering and geoscience work experience with the core of its mandate to recommend MIT’s to the Council for full membership in the Association. The recommendations of the Admissions Committee are presented to the Council of the Association who decides whether or not the candidate meets the requirements of registration, in the interest of public safety.

>The main document on which the Admissions Committee bases its evaluation is that which is filled out by the applicant, the [Application Form](http://www.apegnb.com/site/media/APEGNB/Application%20INDIVIDUAL%202011%2011%2001%20ENG.pdf). An important part of this form is the Occupational History section, which must be accompanied by clear timeframes. Upon receipt of the application form, a reference form will be sent out to the supervisors so that they can attest the experience. It should be noted that, not only must the timeframes be signed off, but also the supervising Professional Engineer or Geoscientist must affix his or her stamp to the reference form.

>The Admissions Committee puts much weight on the appropriate attestation of work experience by the supervisor of the applicant. In this context, the guidelines in this document help the Admissions Committee to evaluate to what extent the applicant has with engineering or geoscience practice, and, therefore, his or her suitability for membership. These guidelines should also be used bt the supervising P.Eng. an P.Geo.

>The supervising P.Eng. or P.Geo. is responsible to ensure:

>1. that each timeframe of experience which is attested to must meet the requirements for acceptable experience in engineering or geoscience, by using these above guidelines.
2. that he or she is keeping up to date on the details of the MIT’s work experience, through direct supervision and continuous contact with the MIT.

## 受训人员工作日志指南 ##

所有受训人员都应该随时专业地记录自己获得的工程或地球科学工作经验，然后将该日志及其相关的进度报告递交给**实习委员会**。受训人员分别在工作满6个月、2年和3年的时候递交工作日志；最后，在申请专业工程师/专业地球科学家时，递交4年工作经验的总结报告。

APEGNB**招生委员会**之所以安排这样的方法来检验受训人员的工作经验，是为了让他们做好充分的准备去承担专业专业工程师/地球科学家应该承担的义务和责任。

**实习委员会**会通过检查实习人士递交的定期报告来检验他们的工作经验；实习人士递交的定期报告必须由相关监督者签字，且监督者必须是专业工程师或专业地球科学家；如果监督者不是专业工程师或专业地球科学家，实习人士必须申请参加**实习委员会**的**导师制计划**。


**注意:**申请专业工程师或专业地球科学家时，如果能填写并递交完善的受训人员工作日志，你就会节省许多时间和精力。

下面是各种日志及其进度报告表：

>## Member-In-Training Logbook Guidelines ##

>All MIT’s should keep a chronological, professional logbook or journal for all the time that he/she is gaining engineering or geoscience work experience. This Logbook (and the corresponding Progress Report) will be submitted to the Internship Committee for examination. Logbooks will be submitted after 6 months of employment, after 2 years of employment, and finally after 3 years of employment. A summary of your 4th year of employment will be submitted with your P.Eng./P.Geo. application.

>This method of verification of the MIT’s work experience was put in place by the Admissions Committee of APEGNB to help MIT’s and their employers so that the MIT’s will be well prepared to assume the obligations and responsibilities in engineering or geoscience which the title Professional Engineer/Geoscientist conveys.

>The Internship Committee verifies the work experience of the MIT by examining the periodic reports submitted by the MIT which have be signed by the MIT’s supervisor, who must be a P.Eng. or P.Geo. If the MIT’s supervisor is not a P.Eng. or P.Geo, the MIT must apply to join the Mentorship Program of the Association.

>**Please note:** You will save much time and effort when you go to apply for P.Eng or P.Geo status, if you fill out and submit well written, timely logbooks reports while a MIT.

## 受训人员导师计划

**新不伦瑞克专业工程师与地球科学家协会**的导师计划是一个审计和指导计划，专门为那些不在专业工程师或地球科学家监督下参与工程或地球科学工作的受训人员而设计。专业工程师或地球科学家这些导师会定期咨询和审查实习人士，最终让他们达到专业工程师或地球科学家的注册要求。

**Note:** 只有受训人员才可以参与该计划！

导师负责检查相关受训人员接受必要培训和工程或地球科学经验，确保其达到注册要求，并每隔三个月通知APEGNB进度。 导师和受训人员同时负责演示复杂工作的工作进进度，确保这些季度报告可以在申请人申请注册专业工程师或地球科学家之前获得足够的工程或地球科学经验。（有关季度报告的准备，见：[5 points](http://www.apegnb.com/en/home/membersintraining/guidelines.aspx#5points)）由于导师体系中的技术和专业指导水平无法和直接监督相比，所以在导师计划必须花费较长的时间才可以获得注册所要求的经验。


**受训人员的职责包括:**

- 选择可以提供合适指导的导师，向雇主寻求帮助。导师必须在工程或地球科学协会或州理事会注册
- 使用**导师批准申请**向协会申请获得导师批准
- 每周都记录工作
- 每个季度会议和导师讨论之后，准备并递交经验总结月度报告，每隔3个月都必须向协会递交完整的进度报告表格、月度报告和导师评价报告。

**雇主职责包括:**

- 同意并支持受训工程师/受训地球科学家参与导师计划，一般为他们提供导师和相关信息
- 填写附件Disclaimer Clause


**导师的职责包括:**

-   每隔三个月和实习人士见面审查工作进度
-   会议期间，导师必须：
 - 咨询受训人员相关技术难题的可行解决方案  
 - 审查和评估受训人员的工作，直到达到工程或地球科学经验要求，并证明工作进展越来越复杂(参见：[5 points](http://www.apegnb.com/en/home/membersintraining/guidelines.aspx#5points)）
 - 如果审查工作经验之后，导师觉得受训人员仍未获得合格工程或地球科学经验，那么，导师必须同时通知受训人员和APEGNB
 - 不断评估专业行为和专业能力
 - 至少每个季度都参观受训人员的工作场所
 - 每个3个月都使用**导师季度评价报告**向协会报告工作进度

**协会的职责包括:**

- 确认导师计划申请者是APEGNB受训人员
- 为不能找到导师的受训人员提供帮助
- 向受训人员，雇主及导师提供受训人员工程和地球科学可接受的经验指南
- 向受训委员会递交申请之前确保收到了导师和雇主的书面同意
- 受训委员会将审查导师计划申请，然后向理事会提供相关建议，该计划认可的工作经验一般都是真实存在的。

>## Member-In-Training Mentor Program

>The Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of New Brunswick’s Mentor Program is designed as an auditing and guidance program for Members-in-Training (MITs) who are engaged in engineering or geoscience work, but who are not working under the supervision of a Professional Engineer or Geoscientist. This program permits an MIT to meet requirements for registration as a Professional Engineer or Geoscientist by the process of periodic counseling and review by one or more selected professional engineers or geoscientists acting as Mentors.

>**Note:** Membership as a Member-in-Training is a prerequisite to this program.

>It is the Mentor’s duty to check that the MIT is receiving the necessary training and engineering or geoscience experience to meet the requirements for registration, and every three months inform APEGNB’s office of progress. The onus is on the Mentor and MIT to demonstrate the progression into work of greater complexity as well as to ensure that the quarterly reports indicate that sufficient engineering or geoscience experience has been obtained prior to application for registration as a Professional Engineer or Geoscientist. Please refer to the [5 points](http://www.apegnb.com/en/home/membersintraining/guidelines.aspx#5points) found in the Guidelines for Acceptable Engineering or Geoscience Experience for Members-in-Training when preparing reports. Due to the reduced level of technical and professional guidance available in a Mentor System when compared to direct supervision, it can reasonably be expected that additional time may be required to gain the experience needed for registration.

>The following guidelines outline the duties and responsibilities of the MIT:

>- To select an appropriate Mentor who will provide suitable guidance, and to seek support of the Employer. The Mentor must be registered with an engineering and/or geoscience association / ordre / state board.
- To apply to the Association for approval of the Mentor using the Mentor Approval Application.
- To keep a weekly work diary.
- To prepare and submit brief monthly reports summarizing experience to be discussed with the Mentor at each of the quarterly meetings. The completed Progress Report Form must be submitted to the Association along with the monthly reports and the Mentor’s Evaluation Report every THREE (3) months.

>The following guidelines outline the duties of the Employer:

>- The employer agrees to support the EIT/GIT in the Mentor System by providing the Mentor access to the EIT/GIT's workplace and any necessary information required to access the EIT/GIT's work.
- The employer completes the attached Disclaimer Clause.

>The following guidelines outline the duties and responsibilities of the Mentor:

>-   The Mentor to meet with the MIT every three months to review progress.
-   During the meetings, the Mentor should:   
    - counsel the MIT with the appropriate approach to technical problems.   
    - review and assess the work of the MIT for suitable and sufficient engineering or geoscience content as well as to demonstrate progression into work of greater complexity. Refer to the [5 points](http://www.apegnb.com/en/home/membersintraining/guidelines.aspx#5points) found in the Guidelines for Acceptable Engineering or Geoscience Experience for Members-in-Training.  
    - if after reviewing the work MIT’s work experience, the Mentor feels that suitable engineering or geoscience experience is not being attained, the Mentor should bring this to the attention of the MIT and APEGNB.   
    - assess professional conduct and ability in a progressive manner.   
    - The Mentor is highly recommended to visit the MIT’s workplace at least once per quarter.  
    - The Mentor is asked to report progress to the Association every 3 months using the attached Mentor’s Quarterly Evaluation Report.

>The following guidelines outline the duties and responsibilities of the Association:

>- Confirm that the person applying for the Mentor Program has been accepted as a Member-in-Training with APEGNB. 
- If the MIT is unable to find a Mentor, the Association may assist.
- Send Guidelines for Acceptable Engineering or Geoscience Experience for Members-in-Training to the MIT for distribution to the employer and Mentor.
- Ensure written consent from the Mentor and the Employer is received before submitting application to the Internship Committee.
- The Internship Committee will review application for the Mentor Program before making a recommendation to Council. Experience will normally be considered to being when the Program is approved.

## 毕业前工作经验 ##

只要你加入了APEGNB受训人员计划，你可以向APEGNB招生委员会递交自己在毕业之前获得的与工程专业和地球科学专业相关的工作经验，同时满足以下条件:

- 该工程或地球科学工作经验是**在学业完成了一半之后**获得的，如果我们没有先存档，你必须递交一份大学官方成绩单副本
- 该工程或地球科学工作经验**必须**在工作期间必须获得专业工程师或专业地球科学家的证明，只要专业工程师或专业地球科学家是注册的，就没必要在APEGNB注册，但工作日志上必须有他们的盖章
- 工程或地球科学工作经验**必须**以类似工作日志的格式记录，工作日志可以到官网下载也可以到APEGNB办公室取，该工作报告必须由监督专业工程师或地球科学家盖章

**注意：**毕业前工作经验中，仅有一年可以算作APEGNB受训人员4年工作经验要求的学分。如果毕业之后打算离开相关省，一定要咨询该省工程协会，毕业前工作经验是否可以获得相关学分，因为并不是所有省的工程协会都会任课毕业前工作经验。

>## Pre-Graduation Work Experience ##

>Engineering- and geoscience-related work experience gained prior to graduation can be submitted for review to APEGNB's Admissions Committee once you are enrolled in the APEGNB Member-in-Training program provided that:

>1. The engineering or geoscience work experience is completed AFTER the mid-way point of your degree (that is, after you have completed half of your degree course load). A copy of an official university transcript must be submitted for review if we do not have one on file.
1. The engineering or geoscience work experience MUST be attested to by a Professional Engineer or Professional Geoscientist during the work term. It is not necessary that the P.Eng. or P.Geo be registered with APEGNB as long as they are registered with an engineering/geoscience association. If the P.Eng. / P.Geo. is registered elsewhere, please have him / her stamp off your work with their engineering or geoscience stamp; and 
1. The engineering or geoscience work experience MUST be documented in a format similar to the proper log book. (Available online or at the APEGNB office). This report must be stamped off by the supervising Professional Engineer or Geoscientist.


>Please keep in mind that ONLY 1 YEAR of pre-grad experience can be credited towards APEGNB's MIT 4-year work experience requirement. If you decide to move out of the province after graduation, it is recommended that you find out if that province's engineering association credits pre-grad experience as not all of them do.
