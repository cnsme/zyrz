## 申请概述 (APPLICATION OVERVIEW) - 飞出国 ##

萨斯克彻温省建筑师协会(SAA)作为该省的建筑业的监管机构，负责注册建筑师为该协会成员和授权公司营业。建筑师如果要在萨克彻温省在建筑业工作，既需要个人会员身份，也需要执业许可。尽管个人可以在不和有执业许可证的公司关联，就能在SAA注册会员，但是他们却没有资格在建筑行业工作。

>The Saskatchewan Association of Architects, as the regulatory body of architecture in the province, registers architects as members and licenses firms.
 Both individual membership and a licence to practice are required in order for an architect to be able to practice architecture in the province of Saskatchewan.
 While an individual may register with the SAA without associating with a licensed firm, this does not render them eligible to practice architecture.

1996年的建筑师法令的规定，‘建筑业实践’或‘建筑业’意味着：

1. 为了出租、或得到期待的报酬，准备或提供管理建筑物施工的设计，而这样的建筑物有其基本的用途-人类的居所
2. 建筑物都有其基本的用途-人类的居所，检查这样的建筑物来判定是否这样的建筑物能大概符合建筑施工的管理要求和建筑施工的报告。

>As defined in The Architects Act, 1996 2 (q), “practice of architecture” or “architecture” means:
>
(i) preparing or providing, for hire, gain or hope of reward a design to govern the construction of a building that has as its principal purpose human habitation or occupancy; or

>(ii) examining a building that has as its principal purpose human habitation or occupancy to determine whether the construction is in general conformity with the design governing the construction of the building, and reporting on the construction of the building.

**称号的保护 Protection of title**

除了SAA的成员，其他人都不能使用有表示是SAA成员意思的“注册建筑师”或“建筑师”,"S.A.A."的缩写，或其他缩写，头衔或名称，缩写等称号。

建筑服务业的规定，包括绘图准备、完成可行性研究、在得到Registration and Certificate of Practice之前的一些活动等，可能会对授予实践许可证的做法不利。

>22(1) No person other than a member shall use the title “Registered Architect” or “Architect”, the abbreviation “S.A.A.”, or any word, title or designation, abbreviated or otherwise, to imply that the person is a member.

>The provision of architectural services, which includes activities such as the preparation of drawings and completion of feasibility studies, prior to the issuance of a Registration and Certificate of Practice, may be prejudicial to the granting of a Licence to Practice.

### 提交申请 (APPLICATION SUBMISSION) - 飞出国 ###

如果完成了申请表，请选择相应的申请，向SAA提交原件，并且支付相应的申请费用。SAA Registrar and SAA Council会审查你的整套申请，这个过程大概会需要60天。如果申请资料不完善，SAA会保留60天，之后这些资料会被退回或销毁。

>Please select the appropriate application and, once completed, submit the original document to the SAA complete with payment of the appropriate fees. Complete applications will be reviewed by the SAA Registrar and SAA Council, requiring approximately 60 days processing time. Incomplete applications will be held up to 60 days after which they will be returned or destroyed.

## 注册建筑师 (REGISTERED ARCHITECT) - 飞出国 ##

在SAA注册的建筑师是经过高度受训的专业人员，他们有权在他/她们的名字后面使用建筑师或注册建筑师的称号，表示他们是萨斯克彻温省的注册建筑师，并且是SAA的成员。他们要遵守1996年制定的建筑师法令的法规。建筑师都已完成了他们的教育、工作和考试。所有的建筑师已缴纳了规定的费用，并且参与了SAA Mandatory Continuing Education Program。

在萨斯克彻温省，建筑师的实践受到那些和持有临时执行许可证的公司合作的注册建筑师的限制。执行许可证是颁发给公司（企业、独资经营者、合伙企业等）的。

**没有执行许可证的个人可以申请注册为建筑师，但是必须签署非执业宣言表，并且把这份宣言表放在申请里面，说明他们不会参与建筑业的实践操作，除非他们获得或加入了一家有临时执行许可证的公司。**

所有的SAA建筑师成员已经缴纳了规定的年费，并参加了SAA Mandatory Continuing Education Program。

>An architect registered with the SAA is a highly trained profession who is entitled to use the title Architect or Registered Architect after his/her name to indicate he/she is a Registered Architect in the Province of Saskatchewan and a member of the SAA. They are bound by regulations made under The Architects Act, 1996. An architect has completed their education, experience and examinations. All architects have paid the prescribed fee and participate in the SAA Mandatory Continuing Education Program.

>In Saskatchewan, the Practice of Architecture is restricted to a Registered Architect who works with a firm that holds a current SAA Licence to Practice. A Licence to Practice is issued to a Firm (corporation, sole proprietor, partnership, etc).
> **Individuals not working under a license to practice may apply for a registration as an Architect but must sign the Non-Practicing Declaration form and include it with their application stating they will not engage in the practice of architecture unless they obtain, or join a firm with a current Licence to Practice.** All SAA Architect members have paid the prescribed annual fee and participate in the SAA Mandatory Continuing Education Program.

- [Registered Architect Application – Canadian Reciprocity Agreement](http://saskarchitects.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Registered-Architect-Application-Canadian-Reciprocity-Agreement.pdf)

**当申请人在加拿大的其他管辖区内申请在建筑业实践时，申请人会得到许可要求的通知。**

**Applicants should be informed of the licensing requirements when applying to practice in other jurisdictions within Canada.**

### 加拿大境内的许可要求 (LICENSING REQUIREMENTS ACROSS CANADA)  - 飞出国 ###

当获得执业许可的建筑师希望在一个或更多其他的加拿大的省份实践时，加拿大的建筑监管机构越来越清楚从业者对注册/许可证要求的困惑。

加拿大建筑监管机构已经制定了互惠协议，如果个体建筑师已经在一个或多个加拿大省份注册/获得执业许可，这有利于个人在其他省份注册/获得许可许可。

>It has become increasingly apparent to the Canadian Architectural Regulators that confusion exists amongst practitioners about the requirements for registration/licensing when an architect licensed to practice in one Canadian jurisdiction wishes to practice in one or more other Canadian jurisdictions.

>The Canadian Architectural regulators do have a reciprocity agreement in place which facilitates individual registration/licensing in another jurisdiction, if individual architects are already registered/licensed in one or more Canadian jurisdiction.

必须注意并解决两个重要的因素：

1. 必须在每个需要注册/执业许可的省份提出申请
2. 个人注册/单独执业许可可能不会（通常不会）使你能在建筑业中实践操作。许多省份要求在你在该省能合法在建筑业中实践操作之前，你打算要去工作的商业公司（无论是个体独资、合伙经营、公司或这些实体的变体）也必须获得许可证/注册。

>Two important factors must be noted and addressed

1. An application must be made in each and every jurisdiction in which registration/licensing is required; and
2. Individual registration/licensing alone may not (and often does not) permit you to practice architecture. Many jurisdictions require that the business entity through which you intend to practice (whether as a sole proprietor, partnership, corporation or variants of these entities) must also be licensed/registered before you can legally practice architecture in that jurisdiction.

如果他们打算在加拿大的另一个省份工作的话，建筑师需要做以下工作：

1. 联系颁发许可证的机构，以获得他们发证结构的详情，并获得你个人和你意向公司需要的申请表。在部分省份，早在“提案申请”阶段或任何形式的宣传要求或代表要求时就已需要许可证。

2. 完成并尽早提交申请表格，以通过他们的审批程序。

3. 一旦获得批准，建筑师和他们的公司（如果获得批准并且适用的话）就能在所在省份向公众提供建筑业的服务。

>
What do Architects need to do if they plan on working in another Canadian jurisdiction：
>
1. Contact the licensing body to obtain details on their licensing structure and obtain the necessary application forms for both you personally and (where required) for your intended business entity. In some jurisdictions, licensing may be required as early as the “Request for Proposals” stage or for any form of promotion or representation.
2. Complete the pplication forms and submit them in ample time for approval through their approval processes.
3. Once approval is granted, Architects and their firms (if approved  and applicable) are able to offer architectural services to the public in the jurisdiction.

在加拿大，在一个省份获得许可的建筑师不能使用“建筑师”这个头衔，或在另一个加拿大省份向公众提供建筑业的服务，除非他们在其他省份个人注册过/得到过许可，并且他们的公司也注册过/得到过许可。

>In Canada, Architects licensed in one jurisdiction cannot use the term “Architect” or offer architectural services to the public in another Canadian jurisdiction unless they are personally registered/licensed in that other jurisdiction and their business entity is also registered/licensed.
>
We trust you will find this clarification beneficial and that it will assist you in ensuring you are always compliant with the licensing requirements across Canada.


**来自美国的申请人应该审查以下国际建筑师部分的信息**

>**Applicants from the United States should review the information in the International Architects section**

## 加拿大/美国互认协议 (CANADA/UNITED STATES MUTUAL RECOGNITION AGREEMENT)  - 飞出国 ##

当前的NCARB/CALA Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) 已于2014年1月1日生效。一共11加拿大建筑监管机构都已签署了MRA。截止到2015年1月1日，完成他们个人的Letters of Undertaking之后，四十个美国Member Boards of the National Council of Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB)已签署了MRA。其余的美国地区仍在考虑是否要签署。

MRA是以在本人居住省份有‘信用良好’的许可证/注册证，并且获得许可证后一年的工作经验为基础的。另外，本人主要的工作地必须是在一个已签署协议的省份。

已签署协议的41个美国地区的清单在打开以下链接后可见：

>The current NCARB/CALA Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) came into effect on January 1, 2014. All eleven Canadian architectural regulators are signatories to the MRA. As of January 1, 2015, forty of the U.S. Member Boards of the National Council of Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB) have become signatories to the MRA through completion of their individual Letters of Undertaking. 
The remaining U.S. jurisdictions continue to consider implementation.
>
The MRA is based on licence/registration in ‘good standing’ in an individual’s home jurisdiction and one year post-licensure experience. In addition, the individual’s principal place of practice must be in one of the jurisdictions that have signed on to the agreement.
>
A listing of the forty-one U.S. jurisdictions that are party to the agreement can be found below.
>
- [January 2015 Bulletin – NCARB / CALA Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA).](http://saskarchitects.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/January-2015-Bulletin-NCARB-CALA-Mutal-Recognition-Agreement-MRA.pdf)
- [US Signatory States and Terretories](http://saskarchitects.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/US-Signatory-States-June-2015-DRAFT.pdf)

需要提供以下材料：

- 由本人主要的实践地所在的监管机构出具的信用证明信
- 证明申请人在获得许可证后工作满一年的一份声明
- 祖国（加拿大或美国）的公民/永久居民的证明
- NCARB出具的认证书

根据以前的互认协定颁发的互认注册证书/许可证不受新的互认协定的影响，只要建筑师一直积极注册并符合所有更新的要求，这些证书会一直有效。

>The following items are required:

>
-  a letter of good standing from the regulatory authority in the individual’s principal place of practice;
-  a letter of declaration from the applicant attesting to one year of post-licensure experience;
-  proof of citizenship/permanent residency in the home country (Canada or U.S.); and
-  a Certificate issued by NCARB.
>
Reciprocal registrations/licences granted under the former Inter-Recognition Agreement are not affected by the new MRA and remain valid as long as the architect maintains an active registrant and meets all renewal requirements.

### 会员申请表 (MEMBERSHIP APPLICATION FORMS) ###

美国建筑师的主要工作地在美国的签署协定的地区，且近期并未在加拿大注册/获得许可，则该建筑师必须完成[US Signatory Registration Form](http://saskarchitects.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SAA-Application-Membership-US-to-Canada.pdf)。

>A U.S. architect, whose principal place of practice is in a U.S. signatory jurisdiction and is not currently registered/licenced in Canada, must complete the
[US Signatory Registration Form](http://saskarchitects.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SAA-Application-Membership-US-to-Canada.pdf).


## 非执行建筑师 (Non-Practicing Architect) - 飞出国

受雇于组织、非建筑业公司、无执业许可的建筑集团或公司的建筑师（非执行）必须要签署一份非执行声明的表格。这个要求尤其适用于受雇于政府（联邦、省或市的）或受雇于机构（例如大学、学校董事会等)的那些建筑师。

如果SAA注册的建筑师从有许可证的公司离职，他们也要立即签署非执业声明，并且归还他们的会员章。如果没有许可证的个人被发现在从事建筑业工作，则会收到纪律处分。

>An architect (non-practicing) who is employed with an organization, a non-architectural business, or an unlicensed architectural corporation or firm will be required to sign a Non-Practicing Declaration form.
 This requirement applies specifically to those who are employed with the government (federal, provincial or municipal) or an institution such as a university, school board, etc. 

>In the event that an SAA registered architect leaves an employment situation with a licensed firm, they are also required to sign a non-practicing declaration immediately, as well as return their member seal. Individuals found to be practicing architecture without a licence shall be subject to discipline.

## 实习生 (Interns) - 飞出国

Canadian Architectural Licensing Authorities (CALA)为继续坚持加拿大既切实又有效的建筑注册/许可项目，设立了Internship in Architecture Program（IAP）项目。CALA所在省份承担着法定的义务来规定和保持教育、工作和进入建筑师行业考核的标准。IAP也会通过增加建筑师和该行业准会员之间的有效交流，来促进提高该行业的水平。要在加拿大获得注册证/许可证，个人必须要提供工作技能和学历的证明，才能向公众提供建筑业的服务。

实习生必须参与IAP，同时会获得工作经验和工作档案，还会从该项目中获得最大的好处-完成考试。仅凭获得的工作经验就会被授予一定的荣誉，同时还会注册成为IAP的实习生。

一旦个人获准成为SAA的成员，他们就可以使用指定的‘实习建筑师’称号。

>The _Internship in Architecture Program_ (IAP) has been established by the Canadian Architectural Licensing Authorities (CALA) to continue to maintain a program of architectural registration/licensing in Canada that is both meaningful and effective. The CALA jurisdictions have statutory obligations to set and maintain standards of education, experience, and examination for entry to the profession of architecture. The IAP is also intended as a catalyst for improving the profession, by increasing effective communication between architects and prospective members of the profession. To become registered/licensed in Canada, a person must demonstrate competency and qualification to provide architectural services to the public.
>
Interns must remain in the IAP while experience is being gained and recorded and while examinations are being written to derive maximum benefit from the program. Credit will be granted only for experience gained while enrolled as an intern in the IAP.
>
Once an individual has been approved for membership, they may use the designation of ‘Intern Architect’.

IAP的目标是：

The objectives of the IAP are:

- 定义和存档建筑实践领域的专业知识和技能，这些知识和技能只能在结构化、受监督和有指导的工作环境下获得。
- 为实习活动的文件证明和定期评估提供一个统一的体系
- 为实习生提供反馈和指导
- 在发展和培训以后成员的过程中，接收该行业的新成员
>
*   To define and document areas of architectural practice in which professional knowledge and skills must be gained in a structured, supervised and mentored environment;
*   To provide a uniform system for documentation and periodic assessment of internship activities;
*   To provide feedback and guidance to the intern;
*   To involve the members of the profession in the development and training of future members.

### 教育要求 (Education Requirements) - 飞出国

CALA的管辖区在[Canadian Architectural Certification Board (CACB)](http://www.cacb-ccca.ca/ "Canadian Architectural Certification Board")条款中已制定了基本的教育标准，这些条款是为在建筑业中专业的学历课程的认证制定的，也是为教育学历（加拿大教育标准）的认证制定的条款和程序。

建筑业中的专业课程的认证和建筑业毕业生的教育学历的认证是在CACB的支持下，根据CALA省份制定的标准进行的。如果你要了解更多信息，请[联系CACB](http://www.cacb-ccca.ca/ "Canadian Architectural Certification Board").

>The CALA jurisdictions have established common education standards as detailed in the [Canadian Architectural Certification Board (CACB)](http://www.cacb-ccca.ca/ "Canadian Architectural Certification Board") Conditions for Accreditation for professional degree programs in architecture and in the Conditions and Procedures for the Certification of Educational Qualifications (Canadian education standard). 

>
The accreditation of professional programs in architecture and the certification of education qualifications of architecture graduates are conducted under the auspices of the CACB in accordance with the standards set by the CALA jurisdictions. If you require further information, [contact the CACB](http://www.cacb-ccca.ca/ "Canadian Architectural Certification Board").

### 工作经验要求 (Experience Requirements) - 飞出国

在萨斯克彻温省，1996年的建筑师法令规定至少要在获得理事会授权的前辈的指导下工作一年。除了规定的时间要求，实习生只有达到获得三年工作经验的要求，才能申请SAA的会员身份。实习生在SAA注册的日期或获准从互惠的CALA的管辖区转移过来的日期从三年内开始计时。
>
In Saskatchewan, [_The Architects Act, 1996_](http://saskarchitects.com/regulatory-information/architects-act-saa-bylaws/ "Architects Act & SAA Bylaws") requires at least three years’ experience under the direction of a person(s) approved by Council. Regardless of hours logged, the intern is not eligible to apply for SAA membership until the three year requirement has been achieved. The intern’s registration date with the SAA or approved transfer from a reciprocal CALA jurisdiction begins the counting of the three years.

## 有丰富经验的国外学历建筑师 (BROADLY EXPERIENCED FOREIGN ARCHITECT (BEFA))  - 飞出国 ##

BEFA项目是为在国外受训的建筑师简化在加拿大获得注册/许可认证的过程。由十一个省和地区的加拿大CALA机构设立的，BEFA项目是评估有丰富经验的国外建筑师和在普通加拿大人执行能力水平的对比。

符合该项目资格要求的外国建筑师可以某个程序申请BEFA认证，该程序包括审查建筑师要申请的资格、在线完成的评估和获得许可的建筑师的一次面试。

了解更多包括资格标准的信息，请访问http://www.cacb-ccca.ca/befa

一旦申请人成功的完成了BEFA的程序，他们就会得到BEFA的认证。当CACB颁发了BEFA的认证，这份认证就相当于认可的推荐信，意味着成功的完成了加拿大的教育、工作和在萨斯克彻温省要求的初次注册的考核标准。

>The Broadly Experienced Foreign Architect (BEFA) program streamlines the process for foreign-trained architects to become certified for registration/licensure in Canada. Launched by the eleven provincial and territorial Canadian Architectural Licensing Authorities (CALA), the BEFA program assesses the broadly based experience of foreign architects against pan-Canadian standards of competency for practice in Canada.
>
Foreign architects who meet the program eligibility requirements can apply for BEFA Certification through a process which includes a review of an architect’s eligibility to apply, completion of an on-line assessment and an interview with licensed architects.
>
For more information, including eligibility criteria, please visit http://www.cacb-ccca.ca/befa.
>
Once an applicant has successfully completed the BEFA process, they will be granted a BEFA certificate. When BEFA Certification is issued by CACB, it will serve as a recommendation for recognition as an equivalent to successful completion of the Canadian Education, Experience, and Examination Standards required for the initial registration in Saskatchewan.
